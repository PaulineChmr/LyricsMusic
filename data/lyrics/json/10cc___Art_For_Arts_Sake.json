hall\n\nArt for art's sake\nMoney for God's sake\nArt for art's sake\nMoney for God's sake\n\nGimme the readys\nGimme the cash\nGimme a bullet\nGimme a smash\nGimme a silver\nGimme a gold\nMake it a million for when I get old\n\nArt for art's sake\nMoney for God's sake\nArt for art's sake\nMoney for God's sake\n\nMoney talks so listen to it\nMoney talks to me\nAnyone can understand it\nMoney can't be beat\nOh no\n\nWhen you get down\nDown to the root\nDon't give a damn\nDon't give a hoot\nStill gotta keep makin' the loot\nChauffeur driven\nGotta make her quick as you can\nGive her lovin'\nMake you a man\nGet her in the palm of your hand\nBread from Heaven\n\nGimme a country\nWhere I can be free\nDon't need the unions\nBurying me\nKeep me in exile the rest of my days\nBurn me in hell but as long as it pays\n\nArt for art's sake\nMoney for God's sake\nArt for art's sake\nMoney for God's sake\nArt for art's sake\nMoney for God's sake\nArt for art's sake\nMoney for God's
