ain't never, goin nowhere\nListen to me\n\nLast night I allmost cried when you told me\nThat you think you love me more than I love you\nSometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone\nLets be clear and get a few things straight\nNo ones ever gunna take your place in my heart\nNothing can measure the love that I've got for you\nI'm telling you\n\nWhen I'm out in the club at night\nYou don't have to worry about a thing\n'cause I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't goin nowhere\nSo my heart is telling me that you are the one\nThat I'm gon be with for the rest of my life\nAnd I ain't goin nowhere\nI know you've heard it all before\nYou don't have to worry no more\n'cause I ain't goin nowhere\nBaby just trust me\nAs long as you love me\nI ain't never goin nowhere\n\nI was lost and abandoned\nSearching for the truth\nLooking for that missing one\nThat missing one was you\nThe road was so tough\nBut you gave it up\nUntill I found you and you made it\nWorth the wait and worth the years\nWorth the strength and worth the tears\nAnd you don't know the half of it\nBut baby heres the rest of it\n\nDid you know that your a gift far brighter than the sun?\nDid you know that your a blessing, and I'm the lucky one\nDid you know that I could never ask for a better love\nDid you know that I would die, before I broke your heart\nDid you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart\nAnd never come back together, baby that's for real\nSo the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this\n\nWhen I'm out in the club at night\nYou don't have to worry about a thing\n'cause I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't goin nowhere\nSo my heart is telling me that you are the one\nThat I'm gon be with for the rest of my life\nAnd I ain't goin nowhere\nI know you've heard it all before\nYou don't have to worry no more\n'cause I ain't goin nowhere\nBaby just trust me\nAs long as you love me\nI ain't never goin nowhere\n\nWhen I'm out in the club at night\nYou don't have to worry about a
