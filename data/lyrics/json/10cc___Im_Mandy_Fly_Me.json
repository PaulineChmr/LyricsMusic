"Just like a rollin' stone\nI'm outside lookin' in\nBut if your chance came would you take it?\nWhere on earth do I begin?\n\nI'm Mandy, fly me\n\nI've often heard her jingle\nIt's never struck a chord\nWith a smile as bright as sunshine\nShe called me through the poster\nAnd welcomed me aboard\n\nShe led me she fed me\nShe read me like a book\nBut I'm hiding in the small print\nWon't you take another look?\nAnd take me away\nTry me, Mandy, fly me away\n\nThe world was spinning like a ball\nAnd then it wasn't there at all\nAnd as my heart began to fall\n\n[Instrumental/Bridge]\n\nI saw her walking on the water\nAs the sharks were comin' for me\nI felt Mandy pull me up, give me the kiss of life\nJust like the girl in Dr. No No No No\nOh, when they pulled me from the wreckage\nAnd her body couldn't be found\nWas it in my mind it seems\nI had a crazy dream\nI told them so but they said no no no no\n\nI found me on a street\nAnd starin' at a wall\nIf it hadn't have been for Mandy\nHer promise up above me\nWell I wouldn't be here at all\nSo if you're travellin' in the sky\nDon't be surprised if someone says Hi\nI'm Mandy, fly me"}}], "artist": "10cc"}
