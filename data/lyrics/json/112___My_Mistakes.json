right\nYou promise me\nYou give me a life\nIf I could be\nWell then just a typical\nGuy to lie to your face\nHow could I do\nThe things that I say I wouldn't do\nKeep doing the same\nI give you\nMight just too pitiful\nTo recognize your worth\n\nNow you tell me that before\nPromise that I wouldn't go there no more\nYou gave me all of you\nBut what did I go do\nAnd everytime I had the chance\nTo get into another nigga woman's pants\nI would follow through\nNot thinking of me and you\n\n[Chorus:]\nIf I could erase, everyone of my mistakes\nTell me would it make you wanna come over\nAnd work this

please listen to me\n\nWhen you took me back before\nI promise that I wouldn't go there no more\nYou gave me all of you\nBut what did I go do\nAnd everytime I had the chance\nTo get into another nigga woman's pants\nI would follow through\nWithout thinking of me and you\n\n[2x Chorus]\nIf I could erase, everyone of my mistakes\nTell me would it make you wanna come over\nAnd work this out with

know I don't deserve to be a part\nOf anyone tryna give me the heart\nThey loving me\nBaby please\nCome on over and talk to me\nI see you like you've never seen him before\n'cause you're the only one to show me the love\n\n[Repeat Chorus]\nIf I could erase, everyone of my mistakes\nTell me would it make you wanna come over\nAnd work this out with me\nAnd now I'll do whatever it takes\nJust meet me
