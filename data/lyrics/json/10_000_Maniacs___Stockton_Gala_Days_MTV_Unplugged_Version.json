summer fields grew high with foxglove stalks and ivy\nWild apple blossoms everywhere\nEmerald green like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me\nThere was no girl as warm as you\n\nHow I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need\nYou'll never, you'll never know\n\nThe summer fields grow high\nWe made garland crowns in hiding, pulled stems of flowers from my hair\nBlue in the stream like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me\nThere was no girl as bold as you\n\nHow I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need\nYou'll never, you'll never know\nYou'll never know\n\nViolet serene like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me\nThere was no girl as warm as you\n\nHow I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need\nYou'll never, you'll never know\nYou'll never know\n\nThat summer fields grow high\nWe had wildflower fever\nWe had to lay down where they grow\n\nHow I've learned to hide, how I've locked inside, you'd be surprised if shown\nBut you'll never, you'll never know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/abc915b2b7935e035b71fd1e05a78727.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "10,000 Maniacs", "json": {"annotation_count": 1,
