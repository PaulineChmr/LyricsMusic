paint my face and wear red huh?\nYou ever wonder how it came to this?\nTrying to find someone to blame for this\nHow the fuck did I get framed for this\nWhat the fuck I ever do to you?\nI musta seemed like a fool to you\nI was just tryin to be cool to you\nWhat the fuck am I supposed to do?\nFuck you and your attitude\nFuck you and all the fucked up things you do\nFuck you and everyone that you compare me to\nIt doesn\u2019t matter cuz I found someone better than you\nFlyer too, but she much more finer than you\nAnd her ass sit up a little higher than yours\nAnd her pussy much tighter than yours\nA better rider too\nEver wonder how it came to this?\nYou\u2019re the only one to blame for this\nNow get lost\nNow get off my dick stupid I don\u2019t owe you shit!\nI won't be your stepping stonex4\nCuz I don\u2019t need you!\nYou\u2019re a fucking liar\nCan't trust anyone\nPublic school, Sunday school, even sesame street\nHuh, check it\nI remember how it used to be\nI remember what you said to me\nAnd all the lies that you fed to me\nYou only wanted to control me\nTo use me, and confuse me, but you\u2019ll see\nI ain't a god damn slacker or an under achiever\nIm a warrior im an anarchist\nFuck authority, fuck the world, fuck you bitch!\nFuck the police, fuck the rich, fuck that pussy emo shit\nThose little faggots suck so much dick, it makes me sick\n(Haha)\nYou ever wonder
