momma said\nShe said you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit\nAnd if we all went out without our shoes on\nTell me where would we be, where would we be\nIf all the people in the world lost their reason\nWhat would we see, where would we be\nIf all the entertainers in the world lost their music\nWhat would they play, what could they say\nTo pacify the crowd, to justify themselves\nWon't feel the benefit\nYou're like a cloud behind the sun\nLike the face behind the clown\nYou're moving like the wrinkles in a frown\nAnd you can never look back\nA leaf that's borne upon the wind\nA cardboard suitcase in your hand\nThe wanderer soon returns\nAnd finds the colour of the grass is just the same\nOn the other side of the tracks, oh no\n\"A\" LATIN BREAK\nOoh when you smile it's like a holiday\nOoh pack your bags and we can get away\nWe'll float on a Queen down to Rio\nThere's no need to shave\nWe'll be stinking like rum in a punch\nYou can walk on the water\nYou can dabble in the mumbo jumbo\nYou can smoke a little ganja\nFloat like a cloud over Rio, Rio\nYou can ride with the Gauchos\nSwinging your bolas in a red bandana\nYou can run with the devil\nTakin' your chances with Senorita\nYou can drink a lot of coffee in Brazil\nBut the bill is gonna make you I'll\n\"FEEL THE BENEFIT\"\nSo, you can go out on the street and take your chances\nBut if you do, you better do it right\nOr you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit\nSpin the wheel and take your chances\nAnd your number might come up\nThough the odds may be in favor of the house\nIf all the people in the world would say together\nWe're all black and white, we're all day and night\nIf all the people in the world could sing together\nHow would it sound, what would we feel\nWe'd all feel the
