afraid that this is building up for far too long\n\nAnd this is not the time or place for us speak like this\nSo dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water\n\nIn a different time or place the words can make more sense\nSo dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water\n\nEven though it's the last time\n\nLove\nThis is getting the best of me\nAnd truth be told, you were the start of it all\nNow you my dear, might end up lonely\nBefore you go, there's something you should know\n\nAnd this is not the time or place for us to speak like this\nAnd if I ever had the thought I'd never dream of it\nSo dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water\n\nIn a different time or place the words can make more sense\nIn a perfect world, the future wouldn't make it then\nSo dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water\n\nEven though it's the last time\n\nThis is not the time or place for us to speak like this\nAnd if I ever had the thought I'd never dream of it\nSo dry your
