The rental of some self control\nWhen you lose your mind\nIs when you start to find your soul unfold\nThis morning when I woke up\nAll the thoughts that I had just broke up\nBroken fragments of my dreams left me choked up\nDistant memories I'd repressed all spoke\nAaaaah Fuck\nThis was something that I wasn't expecting\nMy dreams solidifies and started asking me questions\nAnd the deeper I looked into their hate-filled eyes\nI realised they were you, only in disguise\nSo I jumped to my feet\nHow the fuck did I become so weak?\nToo soon did I admit defeat\nI grabbed a pen and start writing to the beat\nAnd I wrote:\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I get back from hell again\nI'm gonna be so elegant\nThe relevance of my benevolence is evident\n\nWhen I get back from hell again\nI'm gonna be so elegant\nThe relevance of my\n\n[Verse 2]\nAs time went by\nI realised you can't just drop out\nBut I'm telling you man\nIt's hard to block out\nThe sound that rebounds and resounds\nAnd resounds again\nOff the walls of my mind\nCause I miss my friend\nBut now I'm on a mission to mend\nEverything that broke and make it glisten again\nStrip down redesign construct and improve\nWhile the rest procrastinate I'll be making my move\nI hope in years to come I've elevated\nBut chances are I'll be inebriated\nBut that's cool\nAs long as my mind ain't sedated\nAnd the things that I've learned\nHaven't been erased and wasted\nWhen you forget about the hand your dealt\nAll that really matters is the things you've felt\nSo fuck it, bring on the good and bad times\nIf rapping don't work I'll start a band of mimes\nWhen you forget about the hand you're dealt\nAll that really matters is the things you've felt\nSo fuck it, bring on the good and bad times\nIf rapping don't work I'll start a band of mimes when\n\n[Hook] x6\nWhen I get back from hell again\nI'm gonna be so elegant\nThe relevance of my benevolence is evident", "image":
