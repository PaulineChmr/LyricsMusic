ringing in my ears\nDo you remember where we used to sleep at night?\nI couldn't feel you, you're always so far away\n\n[Verse 2: Hoppus & Carol]\nThe first time I saw you, you turned away\nI couldn't

don't make me sleep alone\nIf I could, I'd only want to make you smile\nIf you were to stay with me a while\n\n[Verse 3: Hoppus & Carol]\nThe next time I see you, you'll turn away\nI'll say \"hello,\"
