through life for excess in this world\nDies a lonely man, careless of his soul\nThrowing caution to the wind with foolish ignorance\nYou're full of pride\nAnd in arrogance you can't accept the nearing end of this short lived life\nSmile and give a toast, brag and boast\nFool the world with all of your lies\nThe parasite's host never even knows\nPull the wool over our eyes\nWalk the line and pay the price\nA pound of flesh for paradise\nWear the wounds of your demise\nFail to mention your intentions, fail to mention why\nThe actions of your life contradict your words...\nThe path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse\nWashing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence\nIgnore the signs\nFrom cradle to grave, you chose to trade\nA pound of flesh for paradise\nWear the wounds of your demise"}}], "artist": "10 Years"}
