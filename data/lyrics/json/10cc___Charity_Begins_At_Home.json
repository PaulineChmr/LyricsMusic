{"songs": [{"title": "Charity Begins At Home", "album": "\u2026 Meanwhile", "year": null, "lyrics": "A shake of the tin\nThe money drops in, but is it a sin\nYou're standing in rags\nYou're selling your flags\nBut who gets the dough at the end of the day\nWe saw your drop-dead fancy wheels\nYour little house up on the hill\nBut when your conscience pricks\nA little sacrifice sweetens the pill\nSo keep your hands in your pockets\nCharity begins at home\nKeep your hands in your pockets\nCharity won't leave you alone\nWe take to the stage\nThe audience rave, we're doing our bit\nA heavenly cast, a blast from the past\nThere's a song to be sung, will it make number one\nWe wanna see your money roll\nBut our eyes are on the hall of fame\n'cos business is business\nAnd hits are the name of the game\nSo keep your hands in your pockets\nCharity begins at home\nKeep your hands in your pockets\nCharity won't leave you alone\nEverywhere that we turn\nThere are mouths to be fed\nHow can we sleep\nThe battle goes on while we're\nSafe in our beds\nSo don't turn away\nNo don't turn away\nYour doors are locked\nYou switch on the box to take in a show\nYou think that you're safe\nBut here comes that face\nAnd wouldn't you know it's that message again\nThey want to take your plastic cash\nYour hand reaches out to the phone\nKeep your hands in your pockets\nCharity begins at home\nKeep your hands in your pockets\nCharity begins at home\nKeep your hands in your pockets\nCharity won't leave you alone\nEverywhere that we turn\nThere are mouths to be fed\nHow can we sleep\nThe battle goes on while we're\nSafe in our beds\nSo don't turn away\nNo don't turn away\nKeep your hands in your pockets\nCharity begins at home\nKeep your hands in your pockets\nCharity won't leave you alone\n(repeat 5x)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b095581dc4fdc9fe1edb8ff29a9c7525.997x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "10cc", "json": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1203211",
