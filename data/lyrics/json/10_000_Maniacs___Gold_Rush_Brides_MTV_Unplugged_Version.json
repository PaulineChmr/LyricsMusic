(by Lillian Schlissel)]\n\nWhile the young folks were having their good times\nSome of the mothers were giving birth to their babies\nThree babies were born in our company that summer\nMy cousin Emily gave birth to a son in Utah\nForty miles north of the Great Salt Lake one morning\nBut the next morning she traveled on\n'til noon when a stop was made and another child was born\nThis time Susan Mollmeyer\nAnd gave the baby the name Alice Nevada\n\nFollow the typical signs the hand-painted lines down prairie roads\nPass the lone church spire\nPass the talking wire from where to who knows\nThere's no way to divide the beauty of the sky from the wild western plains\nWhere a man could drift in legendary myth by roaming over spaces\nThe land was free and the price was right\n\nDakota on the wall is a white-robed woman broad yet maidenly\nSuch power in her hand as she hails the wagon man's family\nI see Indians that crawl through this mural that recalls our history\n\nWho were the homestead wives\nWho were the gold rush brides\nDoes anybody know\nDo their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote\nThe land was free yet it cost their lives\n\nIn miner's lust for gold a family's house was bought and sold piece by piece\nA widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name so painfully\nIn letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters\nThey would moan as they would read accounts of\nMadness childbirth loneliness and grief", "image": "https://images.genius.com/abc915b2b7935e035b71fd1e05a78727.1000x1000x1.png", "artist":
