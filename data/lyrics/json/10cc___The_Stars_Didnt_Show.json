magic spell\nYou played the part so well\nYour music blew away the darkness\nWe loved you for better\nWe loved you for worse\nBut we never took you for granted\nYour lives were a blessing\nBut they carried a curse\nThe night that the stars didn't show\nYou made me stand so proud\nI was lifted from the crowd\nThe fire inside me burning\nThe figure dressed in black\nSending shivers down my back\nDeep inside my soul was stirring\nWe loved you for better\nWe loved you for worse\nThe sweet inspiration that you gave us\nAnd i can remember we didn't rehearse\nThe night that the stars didn't show\nMountains may crumble\nAnd worlds fall apart\nLovers and friends may desert me\nThe road may be long\nBut i know in my heart\nYour spirit will always be with me\nThe thrill to be up there\nA sea of faces everywhere\nI look i find you\nWe loved you for better\nWe loved you for worse\nBut we never took you for granted\nYour lives were a blessing\nBut they carried a curse\nThe night that the stars didn't show\nWe loved you for better\nWe loved you for worse\nThe sweet inspiration that you gave us\nAnd i can remember we didn't rehearse\nThe night that the stars didn't show", "image":
