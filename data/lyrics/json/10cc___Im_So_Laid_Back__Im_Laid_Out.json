getting higher\n\nThe fire chief was shouting\nAs he knocked down my door\nHe said you better move your butt boy\nOr you'll knock on heaven's door\n\nI'm so laid back, I'm laid out\nI'm so caved in and spaced out\nI'm wired to the teeth\nI'm fused to the floor\nSo baby don't you bug me no more\nDon't you bug me no more\n\nThe rent needing paying\nThe insurance was due\nThe roof needing fixing\nAnd the rain was coming through\n\nBut the forecast is sunny\nSo I'll stay here on my back\nTomorrow is another day\nIt's cozy in the sack\n\nI'm so laid back, I'm laid out\nI'm so caved in and spaced out\nI'm wired to the teeth\nI'm fused to the floor\nSo baby don't you bug me no more\nDon't you bug me no more\n\nThere were times when you wanted to be number one\nAnd the glamour and the glitter were turning him on\nBut he realized that it was better to be number two (ooh)\n\nMy luxury is living\n'Cause I can't afford to die\nI'm a diletantic mother\nWith a twinkle in my eye\n\nLet the others do the running\nI'm content to take a cut\nPercentages are burning\nAnd I'm happy in my rut\n\nI'm so laid back, I'm laid out\nI'm so caved in and spaced out\nI'm wired to the teeth\nI'm fused to the floor\nSo baby don't you bug me no more\nDon't you bug me no more\nNo more, no more, no more, [etc.]", "image":
