you're not having fun\nThe green eyed monster's got me on the run\nPhones keep ringing but there's no one there\nYou never told me why you changed your hair\nSomeone else's lotion on my side of the mattress\nGreen eyed monster's got me by the niagra's\nDon't think i'm mad, it's paranoia\n(i want what you got)\nI'm sad, you're glad\n(i want what you got)\nI'm hungry for your love\nSay the word, give me fever\n(you got what i need)\nKeep those goodies for me\nMidnight shopping is a funny thing\nBut i'm not laughing, you don't wear your ring\nYou spend a fortune but your cupboard's bare\nThe green eyed monster's got his home in there\nSomethings cooking at the laundromat\nDirty washing, i'm not having that\nFifteen visits and my threads are bare\nThe green eyed monster leaves me in despair\nDon't think i'm mad, it's paranoia\n(i want what you got)\nI'm sad, you're glad\n(i want what you got)\nHungry for your love\nYou say, the word, give me fever\n(you got what i need)\nKeep that something for me\nWhat the hell is happening here\nThe more i get to know\nI find out how much i don't know\nWho can i turn to now\nWhen everything i touch\nAnd everything i see\nSeems to crumble into dust\nYou put the evil eye on me\nGreen eyed monster's driving me insane\nAnd jealous lovers play a deadly game\nMy fire is burning but you're as cold as ice\nThe green eyed monster throws a loaded dice\nWho's that creeping out of my back door\nDon't say he's collecting for the poor\nDon't you tell me you're not having fun\nThe green eyed monster's got me on the run\nThe green eyed monster's got me on the run\nThe green eyed monster's got me on the run", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b095581dc4fdc9fe1edb8ff29a9c7525.997x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "10cc", "json":
