the tears she cried, they were criedfor none other\nThan her little boy lost in our little world that hated\nAnd that dared to drag him down, her little boy courageous\nWho chose his words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood\nHip flask slinging madman, steaming cafe flirts\nThey all spoke through you\n\nHey Jack, now for the tricky part\nWhen you were the brightest star, who were the shadows?\nOf the San Francisco beat boys you were the favorite\nNow they sit and rattle their bones and think of their blood stoned days\nYou chose your words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood\nThe hip flask slinging madman, steaming cafe flirts\nIn Chinatown howling at night\n\nAllen baby, why so jaded?\nHave the boys all grown up and their beauty faded?\nBilly, what a saint they've made you\nJust like Mary down in Mexico on All Souls' Day\n\nYou chose your words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood\nCool junk booting madmen, street minded girls\nIn Harlem, howling at night\nWhat a tear stained shock of the world\nYou've gone away without saying goodbye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/abc915b2b7935e035b71fd1e05a78727.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "10,000
