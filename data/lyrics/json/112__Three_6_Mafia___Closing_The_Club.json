when playas meet, get on this level nigga whaaaat...\n\n[Slim]\nGirl talkin' like she gon' be famous\nTonight she got that Goose\nTellin' her that she can take that, take that\nThe beat got her trippin' and the heat got her pumpin'\nAnd she screamin'  at the DJ \"Don't stop playin' that\", playin' that\nOh, shorty's got a body, came her with nobody\nSo tonight ya know I'm gonna frame that, frame that\nShe drivin' in the truck and sayin' you can be my nigga\nBut the night is still young so won't you fall back, fall back\nOh\n\n[Bridge: 112]\nDamn why she frontin'\nWhen she know that she want it\nI can tell how she's on it\nCuz she really wanna see me tonight\nI know what tonight can be\nIf y'all would just work with me\nSee what's in front of me\nJust let me get made tonight\n\n[Hook 2X: 112]\nWhat, y'all closing the club\nI ain't finished drinkin'\nCan't you see me talking to her\nWhat y'all closing the club\nJust give me a few minutes\nAnd she gon' be ready to go\n\n[Daron Jones]\nSoon as I pull up at the club, hop out the six\nMr. Valet would you park my shit\nThen I bypass security\nI'm like, let me off up in the VIP\nThen I, spot shorty chillin' with girlfriend\nAnd I'm movin' close to get the open\nLook down, my watch was frozen\nIt's only two o'clock and the club is closin'\nI know there's something that you wanna, show me\nThat henny got me wanna do something, crazy\nThen they closed the bar\nHow the hell y'all gon' play a star\nI'm almost there with this chick\nNow y'all makin me take her to the car\nNow she's trippin'\n\n[Bridge: 112]\n\n[Hook 2X 112]\n\n[DJ Paul]\nNow y'all can't shut this down yet\nI just got this girl wet\nFrom this watch and this chain around my neck\nWhat's in the lot, I rock a Phantom for a half mil\nHit the lock a
