cry\n\"This is the eden i was to find\"\nThere were lands to be charted\nAnd to be claimed for a crown\nWhen a hero was made\nBy the length he could stay\nIn this dangerous land of hateful hate\nCuriosity filled the heads of these\nThere was an upper room they had to see\nCuriosity killed the best of these\nFor a hero's hometown welcoming\nStill they moved on and on\nWho came building missions?\nUnswerving men of the cloth\nWho gave their lives in numbers untold\nSo that black sheep entered the fold\nCaptured like human livestock destined for slavery\nNaked, walked to the shore where great ships moored\nFor the hell bound journeys\nBought and sold with a hateful hate\nCuriosity filled the breasts of these\nWith some strange ecstasy\nCuriosity killed the best of these\nBy robbing their lives of dignity\nStill they moved on and on\nCalling men of adventure\nFor a jungle bush safari\nCome conquer the beast\nHis claws and teeth\nSee death in his eyes to know you're alive\nEuropean homesteads grew up in the colonies\nWith civilized plans for wild hinterlands\nTheir guns and god willing\nSuch a hateful hate\nCuriosity spilled the blood of these\nFor their spotted skins and ivory\nCuriosity filled the heads of these\nMadmen with the lies of destiny\nCuriosity spilled the blood of these\nThen blotted their lives from history\nCuriosity filled the heads of these\nOne man claimed all that he could see\nCuriosity still entices these\nMadmen with a lusting and a greed\nTheir legacy, legacy, legacy", "image":
