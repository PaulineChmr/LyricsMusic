You don't know the nights i hide\nBelow a second story room\nTo whistle you down\nThe man who's let to divvy up\nTime is a miser\nHe's got a silver coin\nOnly lets it shine for hours\nWhile you sleep it away\n\n[Chorus 2:]\nThere's one rare and odd style of living\nPart only known to the everybody jenny!\nA comical where's the end parade\nOf the sort people here would think unusual\n\nJenny!\n\n[Chorus 3:]\nTonight upon the mock brine of a luna sea\nFar off we sail on to back o' the moon\n\nJenny!\n\n[Verse 1:]\nJenny! You don't know the days i've tried\nTelling backyard tales\nSo to maybe amuse\nO, your mood is never giddy\nIf you smile i'm delighted\nBut you'd rather pout\nSuch a lazy child\nYou dare fold your arms\nTisk and say that i lie\nThere's one rare and odd style of thinking\nPart only known to the everybody jenny!\nThe small step and giant leap takers\nGot the head start in the race toward it\nJenny!\n\n[Chorus 3]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nThat was a sigh\nBut not meant to envy you\nWhen your age was mine\nSome things were sworn true\nMorning would come\nAnd calendar pages had\nNew printed seasons on\nTheir opposite sides\nJenny!\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\n[Chorus 2:]\nThere's one rare and odd style of living\nPart only known to the everybody jenny!\nOut of tin ships jump the bubble head boys\nTo push their flags into powdered soils and cry\n\n[Outro:]\nNo second placers\nNo smart looking geese in bonnets\nDance with pigs in high button trousers\nNo milk pail for the farmer's daughter\nNo merry towns of sweet walled houses\nHere i've found\nBack o' the moon\nNot here\nI've found\nBack o' the moon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a3b67267529718a09a87d20e01496f5f.1000x1000x1.png",
