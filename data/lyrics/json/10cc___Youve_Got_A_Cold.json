a**\nThe mother of them all\nYou've got a cold\nYou've got a cold\nAin't no use in fightin' it\nGet into bed and try to sweat it out\nHot toddies won't help you\nWarm blankets won't sweat it out\nInhalants just choke you\nHot flushes will tell you\nAnyway you've got it\nAin't no doubt about it\nNothin' new about\nYou can scream and shout it\nHot toddies won't help you\nWarm blankets won't sweat it out\nInhalants just choke you\nHot flushes will tell you\nAnyway you've got it\nAin't no doubt about it\nNothin' new about\nYou can't fight it\nForeign bodies in your Kleenex\nYou've got no taste at all\nWhile your system is dyin'\nThe bugs are havin' a ball\nYou've got a beauty, a bad a**\nThe mother of them all\nYou've got a cold\nYou've got a cold", "image":
