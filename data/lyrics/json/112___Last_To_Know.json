fighting\nTell me where it's gone?\n\nGirl I thought that we could talk about whatever\nAny problem that we had we'd always work it together\nDid I say or is there something I've done wrong\nBaby I should know, but I don't, still I wanna make it better\n\n[Chorus:]\nIf something's hurting you then girl let me know\nIf it's me then baby tell me\nYou don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore\nJust don't let me be the last to know\n\n[Verse 2: Daron]\nHonestly you got me torn and I'm so confused\nCause nowadays you got a new attitude\nAnd you barely answer my calls and when I finally get through\nYou rush of the line like I don't matter to you\n\nWas it something I said, girl what did I do\nIf there's a problem it ain't hard for us to work it out\nThere's no difference from what we've been through before\nI can't move on and I won't until we make it better\n\n[Chorus:]\nIf something's hurting you then girl let me know\nIf it's me then baby tell me\nYou don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore\nJust don't let me be the last to know\n\n[Bridge: Mike]\nI never believed we go this far\nDon't you let people tear what we have apart\n\n[Chorus:]\nIf something's
