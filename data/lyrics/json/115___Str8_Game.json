I'm stuck like Chuck and I won't even try\nOver high, eleven five\nI've been smokin all day you can tell from my eyes\nSmoke in my lung you can feel it in my chest\nJust copped another gram now guess what's next\n\nChorus\n\nNow first let's call for the motherfuckin indo\nPull out your crutch and put away your pistol\nNigga this is Frisco bitch I got the bomb\nWhen you're in a rush break it down in your palm\nIf you ain't got ten you can give a nigga eight\nFade with ya niggas then you browse thru the Point (?)\nPick up the bitch and you put her in the back\nBut you better have your gat if the ho is a hoodrat (Jeah)\nAll hoes on the life I lead\nI can't function right without a gram of weed indeed\nI like to smoke to get high\nAnd I won't stop til the day a nigga die\nAnytime anyplace
