Could I?\nHere we are with your obsession\nShould I? Could I?\n\n[Verse 2]\nCrowned, hopeless, the article read, \"living wasteland\"\nThis time you've tried all that you can, turning you red\nBut I will not hide you through this, I want you to help\n\n[Chorus]\nChange my attempt, good intentions\nShould I? Could I?\nHere we are with your obsession\nShould I? Could I?\n\n[Bridge]\nHeave the silver, hollow sliver\nPiercing through another victim\nTurn and tremble, be judgmental\nIgnorant to all the symbols\nBlind the face with beauty paste\nEventually, you'll one day know\n\n[Chorus]\nChange my attempt, good intentions\nLimbs tied, skin tight\nSelf inflicted his perdition\nShould I?

It became the band\u2019s biggest hit, reaching #1 on the US Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and #2 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It is one of the slowest-rising singles to reach #1 at 27 weeks.\n\nThe lyrics, written by vocalist Jesse Hasek, were inspired by the struggles of Brad Renfro, his cousin and child actor who was going through a drug addiction at the time of the recording. He would eventually pass away in 2008, 4 years after the original release.\n\nThree music videos were produced for the song. The first was a more direct interpretation of the song that was directed by Scott Lee and featured Renfro himself. This video can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfV1RO80cjo\n\nThe second video was a more metaphorical interpretation that featured a fish flopping around on a dry lake bed and was directed by Chris Simms. This video can be viewed here. The audio from both this video and the previous one was taken from the original version found in Killing All That Holds You.\n\nThe third and most well-known music video was focused more on the social problem of human rights around the world and was directed by Kevin Kerslake. This video features the logo for the human rights organisation Amnesty International. It was nominated for Best Direction and Best Art Direction at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. Its audio was taken from the re-recorded version of the song found in The Autumn Effect.
