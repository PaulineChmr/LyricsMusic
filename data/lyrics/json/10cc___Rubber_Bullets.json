bullets\nI love to hear those convicts squeal\nIt's a shame these slugs ain't real\nBut we can't have dancin' at the local county jail\n\nSergeant Baker and his men made a bee-line for the jail\nAnd for miles around\nYou could hear the sirens wail\nThere's a rumor goin' 'round death row\nThat a fuse is gonna blow\nAt the local hop at the local county jail\n\nWhatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do\nWhatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do\n\nSergeant Baker started talkin' with a bullhorn in his hand\nHe was cool, he was clear, he was always in command\nHe said \"Blood will flow; here Padre\nPadre you talk to your boys\"\n\"Trust in me\nGod will come to set you free\"\n\nWell we don't understand why you called in the National Guard\nWhen Uncle Sam is the one who belongs in the
