\"it\" defined your stare and all that defines you\nWhen the lights turn bright you look at yourself and can't see a thing\n\nReduced, was it worth it to you?\n\nNow you've left the vineyards of life through the veils of death\nSweet or sour, you ask yourself was it worth the taste?\nAs you look down, does the suit fit well, was it worth the price?\nTry to hold on to your last memories as your name dissolves\n\nReduced, was it worth it to you?\n\nAs the smoke of the burning dead passes through your fingers\nYou try to grasp it, but it's gone, their gone\nYou're gone, it's over\n\nReduced",
