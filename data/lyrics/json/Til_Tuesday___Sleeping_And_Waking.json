still could do\n\nSo fun time is over\nAnd I guess it's enough\nOh, but just for the record\nIt was a little too rough\n\nAll that night when I looked for you\nWithout a word to say\nKnowing that I was looking through\nThe longest night, the longest day\n\nSleeping and waking\nIs the hardest thing to do\nWhen you are taking\nEvery dream I had of you\nSleeping and waking\n\nTell me what love is\nOr rather what you expected\nBecause I've often wondered\nWhat you did not get\n\nWhen all through the town I\nHeard your heart beating wrong, I\nFelt the sickness come on, I\nKnew that you were gone\n\nSo now I'm left with an empty bed\nWhat a place to stay\nSaying things that were never said\nThrough the longest night, the longest day\n\nSleeping and waking\nIs the hardest thing to do\nWhen you are taking\nEvery dream I had of you\n\nSleeping and waking\nSleeping and waking\nSleeping and waking\nMakes the longest night\nThe longest night\nThe longest night\nThe longest day", "image":
