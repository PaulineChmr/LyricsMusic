on\nDry as paper\nCall the neighbors\nWho's to blame for what's going on?\nIn the dark without a clue\nI'm just the same as you\n\n[Chorus:]\nO, they tell us there's poison in the well\nThat someone's been a bit untidy\nAnd there's been a small spill\nNot a lot, just a drop\n\n[Verse 2:]\nBut there you are mistaken\nYou know you are!\nI wonder just how long\nThey knew our well was poisoned\nBut they let us just drink on\n\n[Chorus:]\nO, they tell us there's poison in the well\nThat someone's been a bit untidy\nAnd there's been a small spill\nAll that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea\nSomeone's been a bit untidy\nThey'll have it cleaned up in a week\n\n[Verse 3:]\nBut the week is over\nAnd now it's grown into years\nSince i was told that i should be calm\nThere's nothing to fear\nBut i drank that water for years\nMy wife and my children!\nTell me, where to now\nIf your fight for a bearable life\nCan be fought and lost in you backyard?\n\n[Chorus:]\nO, don't tell us there's poison in the well\nThat someone's been a bit untidy\nThat there's been a small spill\nAll that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea\n\n[Outro:]\nSomeone's been a bit untidy\nThey'll have
