"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn the middle of a caravan\nOn a four-wheel drive oasis\nThere's a man with a thought in mind\nTo cash in on the desert faces\nHe's got a truckload of Yorkshire girls\nFor the harem going places\nAnd the border bums never saw\nThe guns in the whiskey cases\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a real big demand\nAnd it's written in the palm of his hand\nHe's gonna change the face of the desert\nHe's gonna sweep away the sand\n\n[Verse 2]\nHang on sheik, I've got a yellow streak\nI ain't here, I'm a mirage\nGet back Des, keep it under your fez\nAnd don't give us away in the massage\nLook what I did for the pyramid\nI put a pool in and made it pay\nI built an elevator and a film theater\nAnd shipped it to the U.S.A\n\n[Chorus]\nCause there's a real big demand\nAnd it's written in the palm of my hand\nI'm gonna change the face of the desert\nI'm gonna sweep away the sand\n\n[Verse 3]\nHang on friends!\nThere's a lot more goodies in the pipeline\nSo this ain't the time to close the deal\nHere's the deal\nOoh, now you've got a Howitzer all of your own\nOoh, and a Panzer division to chauffeur you home\nGun-running is fun\nBut hang on, friends\nHang on friends\n\n[Verse 4]\nAllah be praised, there's a whole new craze\nWe're gonna shoot up the Foreign Legion\nAnd it's up with the Sheikh\nAnd down with the Frog\nWe're gonna liberate the region\nOh Effendi, we're gonna bury your head in the sand\nOh Effendi, you better get off my doggone land\nHey, Prince of the Moonbeams\nSon of the Sun\nLight of a thousand stars\nYour guerillas are urban\nAnd there's bourbon on your turban\nAnd the sun shines out of your ass\nOh Effendi, I'm gonna grovel in your wake\nOh Effendi, it's all been a big mistake\n\n[Outro]\nYou're gonna cut out my liver\nIf I don't deliver\nThings are getting out of hand\nI'm going to ride off into the sunset\nI'll make a deal with the promised land\nGoodbye friends\nThere's no more goodies in the pipeline"}}], "artist":
