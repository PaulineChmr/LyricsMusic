out\nFrom hotel to the bar\nAll our friends are here\nBut somehow we seem so divided\n\nWe're the voice crying out\nScreaming every song\nNot that anyone understands\nDiving in, Diving out\nThe terrified crowd\nAll our bands are here\nBut somehow they seem so divided\nIf you want to see where the fight is\nLook around...\n\nI hear the sound of a voice inside my head\nSaying things that I can't understand\nTelling me a life may soon be dead I wonder from what hand\nThe words they say are too hard to conceive\nI try my best to never listen\nCan't you see I'm struggling to conceal\nThese thoughts from everyone?\nIt's not that I don't care\nAnd I don't want to hurt you\nIt's just the worst I fear is coming out\nComing out of me\n\nYou know I've heard you say that I'm not real\nI know you think that I don't understand\nTruth is I'm trying hard to deal\nThis is not what I had planned\nIt's not that I don't care\nIt's not that I don't love you\nIt's just that I am here\nTo put you out of your misery\n\nAll of you lovers who think you're in love\nI'll put you out of your misery\nAll of your children born under the sky\nI'll put you out of your misery\nVenom that you can't conceive\nIs pouring out of the depths of me\nYou think you're free, you've been deceived\nI'll put you out of your misery\nYou think the future is warm and bright\nBut it is death and I am your destiny\nYou think you'll be protected by God\nI'll put you out of your misery\nI was put down to bring you down and put you out", "image":
