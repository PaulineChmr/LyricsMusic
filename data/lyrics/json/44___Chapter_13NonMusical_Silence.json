autumn blooms\nIs this what you imagined?\nCatch a glimpse from her empty stare\nHidden eyes behind her auburn hair\nCatch my breath for the smoke the clear\nAnd it's just as it should be\n\nMy best laid plans\nWill build and break your heart\nHer guilty hands\nTear my whole world apart\nMy mind keeps racing\nShe's softly dreaming\nI'm scraped and sober\nBut there's no one listening\n\nAnd we'll wake up in vacant rooms\nPull you close to my aching skin\nBroken glass on the porcelain\nIs this what you imagined?\nWe'll forget what we used to say\nAnd our lives won't mean anything\nPull me close as I drift away\nAnd it's just as it should be\n\nMy best laid plans\nWill build and break your heart\nHer guilty hands\nTear my whole world apart\nMy mind keeps racing\nShes softly dreaming\nI'm scraped and sober\nBut there's no one listening\n\nAnd we'll both take our revenge\nBut we still won't feel any better\nAnd we both take our revenge\nBut we still don't feel any better\n\nAnd we'll both take our revenge\n(But we still won't feel any better)\nAnd we both take our revenge\n(But we still won't feel any better)\nAnd we'll both take our revenge\n(But we still won't feel any better)\nAnd we both take our revenge\n(But we still won't feel any better)\n\nI'm scraped and sober but there's no one listening\nI'm scraped and sober but there's no one listening\nI'm scraped and sober but there's no one listening\nI'm scraped and sober but there's no one listening\nTo me at all", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c7caff23c9fe7d8a3bc278f9e97509e.900x714x1.jpg", "artist":
