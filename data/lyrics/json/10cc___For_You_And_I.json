down\nWe go\nWe're not so hot you know\nIt's like a roller coaster\nOn a downward motion\nOn a one way street\nWe can't control our feet\nWe're on the road to ruin\nDon't know what we're doin'\nShe may be quiet\nShe may be shy\nBut don't you bring her down\nDon't pass her by\nThe world of wisdom behind her eyes\nCould answer everything\nBut you and I\nWe seem to wander in a daydream (ooh ooh)\nWe never look around\nThe world is full of other people (ooh ooh)\nAnd we put 'em down\nWe go\nWe're not so hot you know\nIt's like a roller coaster\nOn a downward motion\nOn a one way street\nWe can't control our feet\nWe're on the road to ruin\nDon't know what we're doin'\nShe's not beautiful\nBut don't make it plain\nYou underestimate\nIt's not a game\nA heart of gold\nBehind the drab\nWould comfort anyone\nBut you and I\nShould try to see it from the other side, mmm, mmm\nWe'll get a shock\nIt could surprise you\nThe world is full of other people (ooh ooh)\nTake a look around\nWe set the pace while others listen (ooh ooh)\nNever make a sound\nThe rain must fall\nBut we can change\nOur understanding\nWill remain\nSo take a moment\nTo wonder why\nThe world keeps turning\nFor you and I"}}], "artist": "10cc"}
