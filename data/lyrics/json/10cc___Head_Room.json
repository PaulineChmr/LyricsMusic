rules\nNow I got the technique\nI'm away\nDevelop a taste for it\nA time and a place for it\nAlthough on the face of it, it's a crime\nI've nibbled the cheese of it\nThe birds and the bees of it\nAre weak at the knees\nFrom making honey\nEvery time\nI'm throwing my toys away\nI'm leaving the boys to play\nWith the boys\nGimme girls\nAnd it's time I was breaking away\nJust gimme some head
