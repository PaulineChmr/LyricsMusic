Do you know you remind me of someone\nBut I'm here making eyes at you\nAnd I think we're gonna say goodbye to the bureau\nClose the files, turn the page, start anew\nClose the files, turn the page, start anew", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3ec801bff8f4fb0451b918cd0fc1d83a.1000x986x1.png", "artist": "10cc", "json": {"annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/887756", "apple_music_id": "582410856", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/887756/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "From hereon in, now the singles are out the way, the album sinks down a level. \u2018Marriage Bureau Rendezvous\u2019 isn\u2019t a bad song -it sports a lovely slow melody and the feeling of nervousness tinged with excitement is exactly what a song about the endless search for your true love should sound like. However, like many a Gouldman song, the words don\u2019t sound like a natural fit for the music, which keeps zig-zagging and altering its form to fit them, even breaking into reggae at one point (the earliest example of what will become a key 10cc sound after \u2018Dreadlock Holiday\u2019 the following year, although here the style lasts a single line). The lyric starts off being interesting \u2013 what could be more 10cc than a Marriage Bureau full of all those chances for missed opportunities and reducing the life-changing state of love into basically looking through a mail-order catalogue? However the song soon becomes a list rather than a proper song (\u2018Would you like a blonde or a black or a blue-rinse? Do you like 'em small, love them slim, long and tall?\u2019) The song becomes uncomfortably cheesy come the middle eight, that swell of \u2018I\u2019m Not In Love\u2019 voices appearing out of nowhere for the line \u2018won\u2019t it be fine when I find her?\u2019 which would have been thrown out of a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland film for being too teeny-tacky. Graham might have done better to have built up the portrayal of his likeable narrator getting ready for his first meeting, hopping in and out of the bath several times, covering himself with cologne and \u2018shaving closer\u2019 than he\u2019s \u2018ever done before\u2019. Against all the odds, this one doesn\u2019t belong in 10cc\u2019s long list of lovable losers, getting the girl at the end of the song, although the pair \u2018turning their back on the bureau\u2019 seems a bit harsh after all the good it\u2019s done them. This kind of natural, clich\u00e9d ending is deeply unusual for 10cc \u2013 usually the date would end with her catching fire or the restaurant being bulldozed the night before or something \u2013 but the closest we come is the slight hint that the pair used to be lovers long before (\u2018Do you know you remind me of someone?\u2019) which might have made for a better ending (\u2018So me and the e3x are compatible after all!\u2019) Either way, \u2018Marriage Bureau Rendezvous\u2019 is another sweet song that sadly doesn\u2019t quite come off, despite another fine performance (this is one of the best vocals Graham ever made) and some promising moments.
