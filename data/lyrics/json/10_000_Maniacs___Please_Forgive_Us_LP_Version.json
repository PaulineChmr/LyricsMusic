last page of our morning papers?\nThe plan was drafted, drafted in secret\nGunboats met the red tide\nDriven to the rum trade\nFor the army that they created\nBut the bullets were bought by us\nIt was dollars that paid them\n\n[Chorus:]\nPlease forgive us\nWe don't know what was done\nIn our name\n\n[Verse 2:]\nThere'll be more trials like this in mercenary heydays\nWhen they're so apt to wrap themselves up\nIn the stripes and stars and find that they are able\nTo call themselves heroes\nTo justify murder\nBy their fighters for freedom\n\n[Chorus:]\nPlease forgive us\nWe don't know what was done\nPlease forgive us, we didn't know\n\n[Outro:]\nCould you ever forgive us?\nI don't know how you could\nI know this is no consolation\nPlease forgive us\nWe didn't know\nCould you ever believe that\nWe didn't know?\nPlease forgive us\nWe didn't know\nI wouldn't blame you\nIf you never could", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7cbc1a76ee98ae0b90142dfc30866f37.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":
