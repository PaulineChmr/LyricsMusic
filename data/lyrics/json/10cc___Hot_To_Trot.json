razor razor (uh huh, uh huh)\nShe was smiling at me\n\nSo I said if you got the notion\nWe could take a little trip to the ocean\nShe said that'll be OK\n'Cause I'm hot to trot\n\nWe were having a ball by the water\nTalking about life and philosophizing (uh huh, uh huh)\nShe was really talking to me\n\nShe said I can't understand why you gotta hustle\nStruttin' and posin' and flexin' muscle\nSo
