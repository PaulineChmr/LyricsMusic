was\nTime to spend together leaving all da world behind n I thought it would last\nBut only time would tell so I waited on time\n\nHow could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder\nWhy I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes\nIt was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you\nAnd you knew something was missing we were running from da truth\n\nBaby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me\nI can't understand da reason, why you, why you\nWanna play me, you said, you would never me said\nYou always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you wanna play me\n\nWe were real, we were chill you would tell me how you feel you wanted me\nYou needed me da only one to ease your mind I was\nCaught by surprise to hear you say you wanna leave\nBut it's cool if you gotta go then go ahead n leave imma be around\n\nHow could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder\nWhy I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes it\nWas you who never listened when I tried to talk to you\nAnd you knew something was missing we were running from da truth\n\n[2x] Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me\nI can't understand da reason, why you, why\nYou wanna play me, you said, you would never me said\nYou always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you wanna play me\n\n[2x] We used to be in love and we used to be so good you used to drive me so crazy\nThat was da time you was loving me like you should back when you were my baby\n\n[2x] Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me\nI can't understand da reason, why you, why\nYou wanna play me, you said, you would never me said\nYou always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you wanna play me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1c81340146174eadaed58085f8da5801.450x450x1.jpg", "artist": "112", "json": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path":
