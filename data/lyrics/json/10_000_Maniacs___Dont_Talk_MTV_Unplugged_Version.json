Let me close my eyes\n\nDon't talk, I'll believe it\nDon't talk, listen to me instead\nI know that if you think of it, both long enough and hard\nThe drink you drown your troubles in is the trouble you're in now\n\nTalk talk talk about it, if you talk as if you care\nBut when your talk is over tilt that bottle in the air\nTossing back more than your share\n\nDon't talk, I can guess it\nDon't talk, well now your restless\nAnd you need somewhere to put the blame for how you feel inside\nYou'll look for a close and easy mark and you'll see me as fair game\n\nTalk talk talk about it, talk as if you care\nBut when your talk is over tilt that bottle in the air\nTossing back more than your share\nYou talk talk talk about it, you talk as if you care\nI'm marking every word and can tell this time for sure\nYour talk is the finest I have heard\n\nSo don't talk, let me go on dreaming\nHow your eyes they glow so fiercely I can tell your inspired\nBy the name you chose for me. Now what was it? O, never mind it\nWe will talk talk talk about this when your head is clear\nI'll discuss this in the morning, but until then you may talk but I won't hear", "image":
