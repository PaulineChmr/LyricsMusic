you who's always shutting down\nNever wanting to talk about\nThe problems we've got\n\nPre-chorus\nOr is it we to blame for all that's goin' down\nAlways say that I love you but\nWe can't work it out\nIt's making us not wanna stay around\nWe need to sit down\n\nChorus\nWhy can't we, why can't we get along\nWhen we know we can't be away from each other for long\nWhy can't we, why can't we get along\nWhen at the end of the day we know we've gotta go home\nX2\n\nTell me why can't I look at you\nAnd see your point of view\nAnd take the back seat\nIs it true that I'm sorta unreasonable\nAnd I don't know how to love\nEven though God sent me to you\n\nRepeat Pre-chorus\nRepeat Chorus\n\nI just can't see it in why just go at each other this way\n'Cause you know, like I know\nWe're better than that\nGirl I have tried everything\nIn the humblest way\nTo be more than just your man\n'Cause you deserve the best\nTo get with the best\nWho just can't throw it away\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\nYou know I love you\nAnd I know you love me\nGirl we gotta believe\nOhh why can't we get along\nWhen we both know that this is home\nBaby why why why\n\nWhy can't we, why can't we get along\nWhen we know we can't be away from each other for long\nWhy can't we, why can't we get along\nWhen at the end of the day we know we've gotta go home", "image":
