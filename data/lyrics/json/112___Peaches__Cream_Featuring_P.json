sweat\nGirl I'm talkin' 'bout\n\nPeaches and cream (Oooh)\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (That's right)\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean\n\nPeaches and cream\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream (Girl you are tasty)\nKnow what I mean, peaches and cream\n\nI never thought that I would be\nSo addicted to you\nOn top, underneath, on the side of you\nBetter yet baby right next to you\nLove the way you're just flowin down\nAnd I can feel it all around\nIn the front, in the back of you\nOoh I love the smell of you\nGirl you know what I'm talking about\n\nPeaches and cream\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean\n\nPeaches and cream\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean, peaches and cream\n\nWon't stop girl you know I can't get enough\nWanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up\nLike peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up\nGot your arms around my neck and I can't get up\nSee the boys 112 we from the A'\n(A' - shorty we don't play)\nAnd when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play\nSo all the ladies in the house if your peach the shit\nPut your hands in the air represent your clique\n\nPeaches and cream (Oooh)\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (That's right)\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine  (Girl you are tasty)\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean\n\nPeaches and cream\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean, peaches and cream\n\nOh girl I need it\nI gotta have it\nIt's always on my mind\nKnow what I mean\nPeaches and cream\nI like it in my car\nOr even in my bed\nOr baby on the stairs\nKnow what I mean\nPeaches and cream\n\nOh girl I need it\nI gotta have it\nIt's always on my mind\nKnow what I

you\nCan't get enough of you\nAlways again with you\nSo sweet, I can't forget\nSo good, girl you make me sweat\nGirl I'm talkin' 'bout\n\nPeaches and cream (Oooh)\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (That's right)\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean\n\nPeaches and cream\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream (Girl you are tasty)\nKnow what I mean, peaches and cream\n\nI never thought that I would be\nSo addicted to you\nOn top, underneath, on the side of you\nBetter yet baby right next to you\nLove the way you're just flowin down\nAnd I can feel it all around\nIn the front, in the back of you\nOoh I love the smell of you\nGirl you know what I'm talking about\n\nPeaches and cream\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean\n\nPeaches and cream\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean, peaches and cream\n\nWon't stop girl you know I can't get enough\nWanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up\nLike peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up\nGot your arms around my neck and I can't get up\nSee the boys 112 we from the A'\n(A' - shorty we don't play)\nAnd when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play\nSo all the ladies in the house if your peach the shit\nPut your hands in the air represent your clique\n\nPeaches and cream (Oooh)\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (That's right)\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine  (Girl you are tasty)\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean\n\nPeaches and cream\nI need it cause you know that I'm a fiend\nGettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine\nIt's even better when it's with ice cream\nKnow what I mean, peaches and cream\n\nOh girl I need it\nI gotta have it\nIt's always on my mind\nKnow what I mean\nPeaches and cream\nI like it in my car\nOr even in my bed\nOr baby on the stairs\nKnow what I mean\nPeaches and cream\n\nOh girl I need it\nI gotta have it\nIt's always on my mind\nKnow what I mean\nPeaches and cream\nI like it in my car\nOr even in my bed\nOr baby on the stairs\nKnow what I
