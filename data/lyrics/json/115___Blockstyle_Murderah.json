the junk\nMashin' niggas [???]\nWe stay loaded, fully loaded\nLet the game be noted\nWe only comin' wit the coldest, hold up\nIn '99 we breakin' 'em off wit major heat\nSweepin' the industry off they feet\nHypnotize 'em wit the beats\nIt's the most hated, America's most blunted\nSee niggas come from the bottom\nThen we turn around and run it\nComfront it, we got cha\nHollow points in the chamber\nReleasin' the anger\nFuckin' around get caught up in the caper\nPeople stoppin' my paper\nAin't no time for no games\nI'm watchin' niggas catch the vapors\nWhile I'm doin' my thang\nI hit the block and I swang\nNiggas and bitches they be jockin'\nThey wanna floss wit us\nCuz they know we 'bout the lock and load\nWe warmed up for the score\n'Bout to hit 'em wit a little bit of hardcore\n\n[Chorus] x 2\nCuz in my lifetime I'd a done gang of shit\nInvloved wit 211's, 187's for the chills\nAnother blockstyle murderah\nAnother blockstyle murderah\nWe 'bout to have it bitch\n\n[Hennessy]\nAnd since I was a itty bitty niggy on the corner\nI was a performer\nNow my music gets women through California\nLove to get up on it\nWe disinigrate all opponents\nAnd represent it, wit windows tinted\nTill you can't control it\nIt's the O to the fuckin' A-K\nD to the A-L-D\nFuck what the haters say, we paper chase\nSo you can't tell me a muthafuckin' thang\nBut the [?]\nWe [?] too much blood gushers\nCuz you ain't the one that run the hood\nWe [?] from the goods\nLike they say, \"Talk is cheap\"\nOh yeah, they workin' the tech\nSo you get swepped up off your feet\nNow break up off of me, heard me\nIn the game\nI'm a fill the lane like I'm James Worthy\nHella slurvy\nYes indeedy that's your boy\nThat would keep the backpack\nAnd the clack-clack, you be destroyed\nYou shouldn't have never got me pumped\nAnd now your soul is full of holes\nThey've come to mop him up\nCuz I was sloppy drunk\nAnd had to pop him up\n\n[Chorus] x 2\n\n[Hennessy]\nIt's just the flossamatic, caught the cabbage\nNigga what, in the cuts, get no bumps\nTill my pockets got the mumps\nAnd when they jump\nWe let them cats off\nThat'll take yo head off\nWit no explination, no hesitation\nNigga just smash on\nBefore the chance was smooth\nAnd all the work, yo ass was through\nHoppin' fences, coherant distance while we passin' through\nI'm here to let you know boy\nWe get to buckin'\nWhen you fuckin' wit them snow boys\nAnd makin' more noise\n\n[Taydatay]\nYou know\nCuz we be flippin' the script\nOn top wit big faces\nKnown in hella places\nIllutin' all the drug cases\nFuck the basics, we goin' all out\nWe got to show these muthafuckas what the Sco be about\nYou got to follow your route\nFollow your route, follow your route\nCuz without the paper\nNiggas gon' be assed out\nI'm talkin' word of mouth\nI said, \"You in it for the whores\"\nYou know my Hunter's point niggas be straight hard\n\n[Chorus] x 4", "image":
