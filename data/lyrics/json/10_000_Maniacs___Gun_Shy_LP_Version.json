the quarter inch cut of your hair\nAnd the army issue green\nFor the past eight weeks\nI can tell where you've been\n\n[Chorus:]\nWell, i knew, i could see, it was all cut and dried to me\nThere was soldier's blue blood streaming inside your veins\nThere is a world outside of this room and\nWhen you meet it promise me\nYou won't meet it with your gun\n\n[Verse 2:]\nSo now you are one of the brave few\nIt's so awful sad we need boys like you\nI hope the day never comes for\n\"here's your live round son\nStock and barrel, safety, trigger, here's your gun\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI don't mean to argue\nThey've made a decent boy of you and\nI don't mean to spoil your homecoming\nBut baby brother you should expect me to\n\"Stock and barrel, safety, trigger, here's your gun\"\nSo now does your heart pitter pat\nWith a patriotic sound\nWhen you see the stripes of old glory waving?\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro:]\nI don't mean to argue\nThey've made a decent boy of you\nI don't mean to spoil your homecoming my baby brother jude\nAnd i don't mean to hurt you by saying this again\nThey're so good at making soldiers\nBut they're not so good\nAt making men", "image":
