hand\nHe knows every move he made\nLate shift, the bell that rang, a time card won't fade\n10:05 his truck pulled home\n10:05 he climbed his stair, about the time he was accused of being there\n\nBut I'm not the man\nHe goes free as I wait on the row for the man to test the rope he'll slip around my throat...\nAnd silence me\n\nOn the day he was tried no witnesses testified\nNothing but evidence, not hard to falsify\nHis own confession was a prosecutor's prize\nMade up of fear, of rage and of outright lies\n\nBut I'm not the man\nHe goes free as the candle vigil glows, as they burn my clothes\nAs the crowd cries, \"Hang him slow!\" and I feel my blood go cold, he goes free\n\nCall out the KKK, they're wild after me\nAnd with that frenzied look of half-demented zeal\nThey'd love to
