like a madness to be leaving the love nest but I'm taking a chance on a place far away\nWelcome to paradise\nWho said you can't live twice?\nYou will find heaven is here on Earth\nWelcome to paradise\nDid somebody say\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on, a coup coming on\n(There's a coup coming on) Bad vibrations\n(There's a coup coming on) Feeling the tension\n(There's a coup coming on) No smoke without fire\nThere's a coup coming on, a coup coming on\nI could smell the danger\nNever dance with a stranger\nBut the music took me and soon I was lost\nSo I questioned a lady\nBut her answers were crazy\nAnd before I knew I was counting the cost\nWelcome to paradise\nLove it but don't look twice\nYou'll soon be living in make believe\nWelcome to paradise\nDid somebody say\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on, a coup coming on\n(There's a coup coming on (Welcome to paradise)) Somebody help me\n(There's a coup coming on (Welcome to paradise)) So much I don't follow\n(There's a coup coming on (Welcome to paradise)) I'm not looking for trouble\nThere's a coup coming on, a coup coming on\nI shouldn't have come\nNo I shouldn't have come\nWhy did I come, hey?\n\nThe clouds were gathering and the temperature rising\nBe no turning back, all my bridges were burned\nThen it hit me, jumped up and bit me\nNow I'm under your spell, I can never return\nThis is your paradise\nNow you must pay the price\nYou should have flown when the coup was blown\nWelcome to paradise\nDid somebody say\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on, a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nThere's a coup coming on\nSee the band on the run, Annie get your gun\nWelcome to paradise\nWelcome to paradise\nWelcome to paradise\nThere's a coup coming on, a coup coming on, there's a coup (Welcome to paradise)\nBad vibrations (There's a coup) (Welcome to paradise)\nFeeling the tension (There's a coup) (Welcome to paradise)\nNo smoke without fire (See the band on the run, Annie get your gun)\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise) Help me, help me\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise) So much I don't follow\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise) I'm not looking for trouble\nThere's a coup coming on, a coup coming on (Ooh, can't you help me?)\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise), temperature rising\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise), temperature rising\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise), temperature rising\nSee the band on the run, Annie get your gun\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise)\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise)\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise)\nThere's a coup coming on, a coup coming on\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise)\nThere's a coup (Welcome to paradise)\nThere's a coup (Welcome to
