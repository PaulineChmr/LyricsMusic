scenes\nWhere those who dare to tread the wheel\nOne day find out what's behind that hill\n\nSpend half a life deciding what went wrong\nTrying to find out what took you so long\nUntil you feel it's all part of some crazy scheme\nIt conjures in your memories 'til\nYou discover what's behind that hill\n\nYou picked me up and we went for a drive\nInto the stained glass cavern of the night\nYou turn to say, your eyes fixed on the rows\nTake me from this place I know\nThe ruined landscapes that I once called home\n\nI don't know what in this world is trying to save me\nBut I can feel its hand and it's guiding me in sign\nFrom lives I've tried to lead\nTo the one that I received\nEach painted sign along the road\nWill melt away in source tags and in code"}}], "artist": "...And You Will Know Us
