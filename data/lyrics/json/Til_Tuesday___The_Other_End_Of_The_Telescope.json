somewhere\n\nI know it don't make a difference to you\nBut oh, it sure made a difference to me\nYou'll see me off in the distance, I hope\nAt the other end\nAt the other end of the telescope\n\nThere was a time not long ago\nI dreamt that the world was flat\nAnd all the colours bled away\nAnd that was that\nAnd in time, I could only believe in one thing\nThe sky was just phosphourus stars hung on strings\nAnd you swore that they'd always be mine\nWhen you can pull them down anytime\n\nI know it don't make a difference to you\nBut oh, it sure made a difference to me\nYou'll see me off in the distance, I hope\nAt the other end\nAt the other end of the telescope\n\nThere, there baby now, don't say a word\nLie down, baby, your vision is blurred\nYour head is so sore from all of that thinking\nI don't want to hurt you now\nBut I think you're shrinking (I think you're shrinking)\n\nYou're half-naked ambition and\nYou're half out of your wits\nAnd though your wristwatch always works\nYour necktie never fits\nNow it's so hard to pick the receiver up\nAnd when I call, I never noticed you could be so small\nThe answer was under your nose\nBut the question never arose\n\nI know it don't make a difference to you\nBut oh, it sure made a difference to me\nWhen you find me here at the end of my rope\nWhen the head and heart of it finally elope\nYou can see us off in the
