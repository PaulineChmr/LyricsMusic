spilling, running, dazzling you\nI was looking the other way\nVoices call from the east\nI saw my roots of the tree there planted at my feet\n\n[Chorus]\nIt could be I'm searching\nFor a place so small\nWith room for everything\nWhere worlds on worlds revolve\nBut how can we wait?\n\nI wouldn't hold you, no\nI wouldn't hold you\nI wouldn't hold you back\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuppose I was the clever one\nAnd words came easy to me\nI could say I was writing a song about you\nYou and me\nMaybe the verse is yet to be found\nBut waits inside of me\nA secret room, a tangled web to unweave\n\n[Chorus]\nIt could be I'm searching\nFor a place so small\nWith room for everything\nWhere worlds on worlds revolve\nBut how can we wait?\nKnowing our ways?\nHow can we hold on?\nStill, you know it's not too late\n\nI wouldn't hold you, no, I wouldn't hold you\nI wouldn't hold you back\nI wouldn't hold you, no, I wouldn't hold you\nI wouldn't hold you back\nI wouldn't hold you, no, I
