eyes you'll make an exception\nI will show you love like no one before\nPut your trust in me, allow me to be there\nBaby give me your hand to hold\nCause the feelings that I have are so complicated\nThat words cannot explain there is only one who knows\n\n[Chorus: 112]\nOnly God knows how much I love you\nGod sees my heart and that it cares about you\nGod knows that I'm thinking of you\nAnd I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew\nWhat God knows\u2026\n\n[Verse 2: Q]\nBaby tell me what, what is the reason\nOne good reason you're so insecure\nCause after all that I have done\nI think you should know by now\nGirl I'm down for you and the love I have is pure\nI wanna help you understand just how I feel for you\nYou're the one that I can't let go\nBecause the feeling that I have is so complicated\nThat words cannot explain there is only one who knows\n\n[Chorus: 112]\nOnly God knows how much I love you\nGod sees my heart and that it cares about you\nGod knows that I'm thinking of you\nAnd I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew\nWhat God Knows how much I love you\nGod sees my heart and that it cares about you\nGod knows that I'm thinking of you\nAnd I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew\nWhat God Knows\u2026\n\n[Bridge: Slim & 112]\nAnd all of my lonely days, only God knows how lonely\nAnd oh the sleepless nights baby, only God sees me cry\nAnd everytime I think of you, only God can read my mind\nGod knows I tried to help you understand\nAnd Heaven knows I miss you\nOnly God can see how much\nCause everytime you go away, I long for your touch\nAnd when I say I love you girl, only God sees my heart\nHe sees my heart, he sees my heart\n\n[Chorus: Slim & 112]\nOnly God knows how much I love you\nGod sees my heart and that it cares about you\nGod knows that I'm thinking of you\nAnd I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew\nWhat God knows  how much I love you\nGod sees my heart and that it cares about you\nGod knows that I'm thinking of you\nAnd I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew\nWhat God knows\u2026", "image": "https://images.genius.com/492a416e7636e175b1e2f6a6f689928e.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "112", "json":
