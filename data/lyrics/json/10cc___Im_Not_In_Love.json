He repeats several times \u201cI\u2019m not in love\u201d, but at the end of the song he realises that he is deceiving himself.\n\nThe band had wanted to write a love song without sinking themselves into the mire of cliches that came with the traditional love song \u2013 so, Eric Stewart suggested a song called \u201cI\u2019m Not in Love\u201d.\n\nThe song was originally written as a bossa nova, with congos and island-sounding instruments like that. The band, however, hated that version \u2013 especially Kevin Godley. They saw the promise it had, but were stuck without ideas as to how it could be improved. Then, out of desperation, Godley said:\n\nWell, why don\u2019t we do it with voices, no instruments? Just all\u2026 a tsunami of voices\u2026 let\u2019s do the whole backing track with voices, like a massive choir, the biggest choir you can imagine.\n\nHowever, the band didn\u2019t exactly have a massive, angelic choir at their disposal. So Lol Creme came up with a further idea \u2013 they\u2019d create the choir themselves with tape loops.\n\nSo the three members \u2013 Kevin, Lol & Graham \u2013 spent three weeks in the studio crafting an artificial choir. They would hold one note for as long as they possibly could 16 times in a row (one for each track on their 16-track machine), then they\u2019d bounce all of that down onto stereo tape. They repeated this process for 13 notes \u2013 a chromatic scale in the key of C. This ended up giving the band 624 voices to work with, in total.\n\nThe band then composed the song by playing the control board as a keyboard \u2013 each member had three faders to work with (which corresponded to three notes) and they composed the song by pushing the faders back and forth. All of the notes play at once throughout the entire song; they were prevented from being fully muted by a piece of masking tape which kept the faders from falling below a certain volume level. This is what causes the harmony to sound like an incredible, overwhelming blanket of sound \u2013 an entire chromatic scale being sung all at once by the equivalent of 624 people.\n\nThe band then recorded a rhythm track which was intended to be temporary \u2013 they were going to record over it with another acapella layer which mimicked it. However, the band liked the way it worked with the tape-choir section and kept it. So the version which was intended to be a sort of intermediary draft ended up being the final version of the song.\n\nGodley, however, still wasn\u2019t satisfied with the song as it was. Something effusive was still missing and he couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. Suddenly, Lol Creme remembered something he\u2019d said while recording the grand piano solo \u2013 \u201cBe quiet, big boys don\u2019t cry.\u201d Godley loved it and wanted it in. However, Creme\u2019s voice just wasn\u2019t right. They needed something else. Just then, the band\u2019s secretary, Kathy Redfern, popped her head into the studio and whispered, \u201cEric, sorry to bother you. There\u2019s a telephone call for you.\u201d Lol jumped up and cried, \u201cThat\u2019s the voice! Her voice is perfect!\u201d And with that addition, the song was complete.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Not in Love\u201d was the second single released in support of the band\u2019s third album, The Original Soundtrack. It was the band\u2019s breakthrough hit, reaching #1 in the UK, Ireland and Canada and #2 in the US.

me\nSo if I call you\nDon't make a fuss\nDon't tell your friends about the two of us\nI'm not in love, no no, it's because..\n\nBe quiet, big boys don't cry\nBig boys don't cry\nBig boys don't cry\nBig boys don't cry\n\nBig boys don't cry\nBig boys don't cry\n\nI keep your picture\nUpon the wall\nIt hides a nasty stain that's lying there\nSo don't you ask me\nTo give it back\nI know you know it doesn't mean that much to me\nI'm not in love, no no, it's because..\n\nOoh you'll wait a long time for me\nOoh you'll wait a long time\nOoh you'll wait a long time for me\nOoh you'll wait a long time\n\nI'm not in love\nSo don't forget it\nIt's just a silly phase I'm going through\nAnd just because I call you up\nDon't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made\nI'm not in love"}}],
