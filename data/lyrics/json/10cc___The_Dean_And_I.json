boy to a man\nLet me tell you while I can\nThe soda pop came free\n\nHey sis one kiss and I was heaven bound\nNow who would have guessed\nMilton's Paradise Lost\nCould be found?\n\nBut in the eyes of the Dean his daughter\nWas doin' what she shouldn'a oughta\nBut a man's got to do\nWhat a man's got to do\nThe consequence should be\nChurch bells, three swells\nThe Dean, his daughter, and me\n\nThey were dating in the park\nThey were smooching in the dark\nOf a doorway for two\nShe whispered \"I love you -\nOoh, you know I never felt this way before\nOoh, you know the elevator in my heart\nHas gone awol awol awol\"\n\nAnd then I kissed her\nAnd when I kissed her\nIt's a wonderful world\nWhen you're rolling in kisses\n\nNow, the paint is peeling\nNow, and when the chips are dowin\nNow, you kinda lose all feeling\nNow, your head goes round and round\nRound and round and round and round\nAnd round and round and round\nI'm throwing myself off this train\n\nHum drum days\nAnd a hum drum ways\nHum drum days\nAnd a hum drum ways\nHum drum days, he's got\nHum drum ways, oh boy\n\nHey, you know I'm really earning now\nMy ship came in with a cargo of dollars\nMy name's lit up on the prow\nIt's a wonderful world\nWhen you're rolling in dollars\nRolling in dollars\nRolling in dollars\nNow", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "api_path": "/songs/1514868", "apple_music_player_url":
