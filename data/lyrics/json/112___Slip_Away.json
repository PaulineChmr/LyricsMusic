you...\nBecause now...\nYou're coming back to me...\nAnd you recognize the love that was once there...\nBut I found somebody else...\nIt's too late...I'm sorry...\n\nYou should have known that I loved you\nYou should have seen it in my eyes\nShould have allowed yourself to\nBelieve in love, and recognize\nThat my love, it wasn't going nowhere\nNoone but you was in my heart\nAnd I can't believe that you would push your love aside\nBaby...\n\n[Chorus:]\nIt's too bad\nYou missed out on me\nAnd it's so sad\nSad that you're gone away\nAnd I'm sorry\nThat you missed out on me\nBut it's too late\nYou let my love slip away\n\nAnd you should have known that I was open\nYou should have seen it in my smile\nShould have allowed yourself to be adult, instead of a child\nBut you are the one with insecurities\nYou tried to put the blame on me\nYou never knew that my love was really here to stay\nAnd now it is...\n\n[Chorus:]\nBaby tell me how...\nBaby how could you\nLet our, love, fade away\nBut you never knew\nI cared for you, and that I loved you\nAnd you never, gave me\nYour everything\nThis love was not for you\nAnd Baby...\n\n[Chorus x2]\nYou should have known that I loved you\nYou should have seen it in my eyes\nSo sorry, but you let my love slip away\nYou should have known that I was open\nYou should have seen it in my smile\nSo sorry, but...\n\n[Chorus:]", "image":
