-\nSomeday we'll be happy again\n\nOh, the rain never comes\nCount my blessings on my thumbs\nAnd the dogs just want to sleep in the\nSun all day\n\nYou know I'll miss you\nAnd thus it begins\nBut I'll release you\nAnd thus it continues\nSomeday we'll be happy again\n\nThere's no way a country like that could die\nTold me that they drift away\nBut that's a lie\n\nWell, I just bought a car\nBut it stays in the yard\nAnd the country that began with a 'J'\nNow ends in my heart\n\nYou know I'll miss you\nAnd thus it begins\nBut I'll release you\nAnd thus it continues\nSomeday we'll be happy
