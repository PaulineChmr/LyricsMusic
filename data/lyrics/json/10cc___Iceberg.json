we all ride\nIceberg-I've fallen in love with an\nIceberg-its only the tip of the\nIceberg-I've heard that it's cool\nI got class, I got style\nBut once in a while out on the town\nI must go\nYou'd better wash out your zone\nWatch out you stone bone headed woman\nWatch out you bone headed man\nIceberg-it's freezin' over Second Avenue\nThere's not a thing that you can\nIceberg-it's comin' over Second Avenue\nYou'd better believe there's nothin'\nYou can do about it\nI was an orphan and I couldn't help it\nI've been in and out of trouble\nEver since they left me in a basket\nOn the freeway\nIt's me that's been doggin' your shadow\nIt's me that's been a shadowin' your dog\nYou got me hung up lock and stock and barrel\nI'll always be behind you in the fog\nSo you better not annoy me\nOr I'll do somethin' that I might regret\nYou'd better not annoy me or I'll do\nSomethin' that you won't forget in a hurry\nAnd I might be back for some sloppy seconds\nYou've heard me heavy breathing on the telephone\nMy word they say that I'm belongin'\nIn a home for crazy people\nBut you know I don't belong there\nI was an orphan and I couldn't help it\nI'd been in and out of trouble\nEver since they left me\nIn a basket on the freeway\nLie lie lie etc\nDie die die etc\nHooray hooray ha ha ha\nHooray ha ha ha\nGet down get down get down get down\nThere's really not a lot that you can do\nLay down lay down lay down lay down\nThere's really not a lot that you can do\nThere's really not a lot that you can do\nAnd I might be back for sloppy seconds\nLife is a roller
