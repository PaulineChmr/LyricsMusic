have a doubt\nAnd always to believe in myself\nNow I see\n\nIt was you\nThat showed me who I am\nAnd taught me how to stand\nFor what I know is real\n\nNow I'm breathin for the first time\nAnd I'm leavin, all this behind\nI've become, what I am because of you\nIt was you\n\nI'm so sorry 'bout the ways\nBut I can't take away my past\nBut you love me anyway\nAnd now I wanna do\nEverything for you that I can\nEven though it won't erase\nThe foolish things that I've done\nThings that blinded me\nBut now I see\n\nIt was you\nThat showed me who I am\nAnd taught me how to stand\nFor what I know is real\n\nNow I'm breathin for the first time\nAnd I'm leavin, all this behind\nAnd I'll stand\nFor what I know is real\n\nSo how can I make this up to you\nI'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive\nNow now that I'm living my life for you\nI'll fight and I'll push and I'll Strive\nCan't you see\n\nIt was you\nThat showed me who I am\nAnd taught me how to stand\nFor what I know is real\n\nNow I'm breathin for the first time\nAnd I'm leavin, all this behind\nI've become, what I am because of you\nIt was you\n\nI can see the writing on the wall\nAs time begins to crawl away from me\nAnd I've become what I am\nBecause of you\nIt was you", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "api_path": "/songs/1329626", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/1329626/apple_music_player", "path":
