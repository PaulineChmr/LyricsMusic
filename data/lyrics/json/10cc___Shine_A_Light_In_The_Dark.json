was hard and the road was tough\nThere were times when i cried lord i've had enough\nPlease don't desert me now\nDon't you leave me stranded now i need a friend\nPlease don't desert me now\nYou've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless\nShow me mercy when i'm helpless\nShine a light in the dark\nHold me back when i get reckless\nShine a light in the dark\nStand me up if i get legless\nShine a light in the dark\nShine a light in the dark\nShine a light in the dark\nI've been down and out and i've been fit to drop\nBut the thought of you wouldn't let me stop\nNow a man should stand upon his own two feet\nBecause the taste of failure is a bitter sweet\nPlease don't desert me now\nI can hear the reaper calling in the wind\nPlease don't desert me now\nYou've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless\nShow me mercy when i'm helpless\nShine a light in the dark\nHold me back when i get reckless\nShine a light in the dark\nStand me up if i get legless\nShine a light in the dark\nShine a light in the dark\nShine a light in the dark\nWhere were you when the chips were down\nI fell apart when i hit the town\nWhere were you when i couldn't get arrested\nWhere were you when the lights went out\nI blew a fuse, did you hear me shout\nWhere on earth do i look for heavens sake\nThere's a brotherhood that i want to see\nGotta take my share of equality\nThere's no harmony in a one man band\nEven god almighty needs a helping hand\nPlease don't desert me now\nThere's no time and i can't fight another day\nPlease don't desert me now\nYou've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless\nShow me mercy when i'm helpless\nShine a light in the dark\nHold me back when i get reckless\nShine a light in the dark\nStand me up if i get legless\nShine a light in the dark\nShine a light in the dark\nShine a light in the dark\n(repeat to fade)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b095581dc4fdc9fe1edb8ff29a9c7525.997x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "10cc", "json": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path":
