over the phone\nShe went and told me her best friend's secret\nAfter she had lowered her tone\nIt was all about forgiving and so\nShe thought that God would want me to know\n\nHer older sisters had both moved out and her parents were divorced\nHer mother lived in a trailer park, not big, but she had a porch\nAnd on top of the piano laid a cat with evil paws\nHer father he was a proud Nam vet I
