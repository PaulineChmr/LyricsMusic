{"songs": [{"title": "My Culture", "album": "1 Giant Leap", "year": "2002-04-02", "lyrics": "I am the sum total of my ancestors\nI carry their DNA\nWe are representatives of a long line of people\nAnd we cart them around everywhere\nThis long line of people\nThat goes back to the beginning of time\nAnd when we meet - they meet other lines of people\nAnd we say: bring together the lines of me\n\nWhen I look back over the years\nAt the things that brought tears to my eyes\nPapa said we have to be wise\nTo live long lives\nNow I recognize\nWhat my father said before he dies\nVocalize things I've left unsaid\nLeft my spirit unfed for too long\nI'm coming home to my family\nWhere I can be strong\nBe who I planned to be\nWithin me my ancestry\nGivin' me continuity\nWould it be remiss to continue in this way\nWould you rather I quit\nCome with that other shit\nMaking people's hips sway\nLip service I pay, but I'm nervous\nI pray for all the mothers who get no sleep\nLike a lifeline, I light lines\n'Cause my compassion is deep\nFor the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep\nAnd this is who I happen to be\nAnd if I don't see that I'm strong, then I won't be\nThis is what my Daddy told me\nI wished he would hold me\nA little more\nThan he did\nBut he taught me my culture\nAnd how to live positive\nI never want to shame\nThe blood in my veins and bring pain\nTo my sweet grandfather's face\nIn his resting place\nI made haste to learn and not waste\nEverything my forefathers earned in tears\nFor my culture\nFall back again\nCrawl from the warm water\n(For my culture)\nWater to air\nYou're on your feet again\nYour feet again\nHello Dad\nRemember me?\nI'm the man you thought I'd never be\nI'm the boy who you\nReduced to tears\nDad, I'd been lonely for 27 years\nYeah, that's right\nMy name Rob\nI'm the one\nWho landed the popstar's job\nI'm the one who\nYou told look, don't touch\nI'm the kid\nWho wouldn't amount too much\nI believe in the senses that I sound\nI have always been too loud\nWon't you help me drown it out?\nAnd When I feel\nWhat I'm feeling is so real\nI'm a massive spinnin' wheel\nAlways digging in my heels\nNow I got the faith to\nFall back again\nCrawl from the warm water\nWater to air\nYou're on your feet again\nYour feet again\nHa, lace up your booty\nGoing back to the roots, continue my interlude\nFeed freakin' for loot\nAnd my spell's been to check what your future brings is now\nAnd your forefathers further know how\nBut now, what happened to the world without the hatred\nUse your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread\nAnd weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best\nSpreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth\nThis is what my Daddy told me\nI wished he would hold me\nA little more\nThan he did\nBut he told me my culture\nAnd how to live positive\nI never want to shame\nThe blood in my veins and bring pain\nTo my sweet grandfather's face\nIn his resting place\nI make haste to learn and not waste\nEverything my forefathers earned in tears\nFor my culture\nFall back again\nCrawl from the warm water\nWater to air\nYou're on your feet again\nYour feet again\n(For my culture)\nFall back again\nCrawl from the warm water\nWater to air\nYour on your feet again\nYour feet again\n(For my culture)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/963bb01c9c2a94bf8e9e17498951b823.300x294x1.jpg",
