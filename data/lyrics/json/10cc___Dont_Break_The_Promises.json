together through this madness\nI've got so many things I want to say\nToo many forces try to come between us\nSo little time to share and talk to you\nIf I show my hand to you in panic\nPlease remember what I'm going through\nI've loved you forever\nBut it seems like a day\nAnd I want to be there with you\nI didn't want it this way\nDon't think I don't trust in you\nI just needed to say\nDon't break the promises\nThat we made today, oh no\nDon't break the promises\nDo you remember counting every moment\nBefore the world we knew was torn apart\nNow when I close my eyes I can be with you\nBut are we really dancing in the dark\nA bad connection leads us to confusion\nWe're all too easily misunderstood\nOh we've been together through these nightmares\nAnd now we've got a chance to make it good\nI've loved you forever\nBut it seems like a day\nAnd I want to be there with you\nI didn't want it this way\nDon't think I don't trust in you\nI just needed to say\nDon't break the promises\nThat we made today, oh no\nDon't break the promises\nThat we made today\nDon't you break the promises\n(don't break the promises, promises)\nIf you do you'll be breaking my heart\n(don't break the promises that you made)\nOh don't forget the things we said\n(promises, promises)\nAt the start oh no\nI've loved you forever\nBut it seems like a day\nAnd I want to be there with you\nI didn't want it this way\nDon't think I don't trust in you\nI just needed to say\nDon't break the promises\nThat we made today, oh no\nDon't break the promises\nThat we made today\nDon't break the promises\nThat we made today\n********************************************************************************************", "image":
