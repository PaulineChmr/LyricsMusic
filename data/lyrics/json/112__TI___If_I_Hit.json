P man, king of the south\nRubber band man, boing\nWith my 4 1-12\nLetting all those suckers for lord know man\nKeep you girl out the club if you want 'em\nMake no mistake we will take your broads\n\n[Verse:]\nWe be rolling with T. I\nSee you come through\nBaby quit your man he be cuffing you\nAnd we like wow, jeans on you\nChick got a fat ass what she needs too\nBaby don't care in them streets\nSeeing how bad you wanna give it to me\nI was saying no\nTo get in there sweet\nShe better know what the rules gon' be\n\n[Hook:]\nWhen you stick, when we split ain't no hits\nWon't you come here with me\nI'm a chill, how cite you are\nWhat you don't know how to let it go\nYou're thick, body sick, got that trip\nKeep this between you and me\nYou can get it any time you want\nThat's one thing you gotta know\n\n[Chorus:]\nIf I Hit\nPromise\nI ain't gotta hear nothing from ya\nYo nigga riding up with that drama\nSaying I done cut this woman\nIf I Hit\nPromise\nThere ain't gonna be no drama\nTell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em\n'Cause you let me bend that over\nIf I Hit\n\n[Verse 2:]\nSay it, don't flinch, let me shirt this flick\nWasn't you the one who said you love to drive stick\nNow you wanna front like you're scared of it\nWhen at the bar you started grabbing it\nI already know how to handle you\nCan do you\nBefore I put the hands on you\nI'm a beat that thing\nLike your man should do\nBut I don't want a repercussion when we do\n\n[Hook:]\nWhen you stick, when we split ain't no hits\nWon't you come here with me\nI'm a chill, how cite you are\nWhat you don't know how to let it go\nYou're thick, body sick, got that trip\nKeep this between you and me\nYou can get it any time you want\nThat's one thing you gotta know\n\n[Chorus x2]\nIf I Hit\nPromise\nI ain't gotta hear nothing from ya\nYo nigga riding up with that drama\nSaying I done cut this woman\nIf I Hit\nPromise\nThere ain't gonna be no drama\nTell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em\n'Cause you let me bend that over\nIf I Hit\n\n[Rap: T. I.]\nThe grey goose make you wanna get loose\nGot your ass bent over in the new Benz coupe\n'Cause the rims same colour as the ride and the roof\nOr maybe 'cause your friend wanna ride with me too\nMaybe it's the way a nigga shine in the suit\nOr a fresh white tee whatever it might be\nA neck like ro or a wrist like freeze\nRings like those, cufflinks like these\nBaby you ain't never met a man like me\nTurn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me\nBefore I get one, but you get like 3\nGotta man well you know there's a chance you might cheat\nBrothers gonna come up with plans to fight me\nI'm only gonna tell 'em once, have 'em finished like a G\nYou're running with the baldest cannon, I'm gonna pull\nSo before you take off you're panties\nWhat you have to understand\n\n[Chorus:]\nIf I Hit\nPromise\nI ain't gotta hear nothing from ya\nYo nigga riding up with that drama\nSaying I done cut this woman\nIf I Hit\nPromise\nThere ain't gonna be no drama\nTell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em\n'Cause you let me bend that over\nIf I Hit\n\n[Outro:]\nBody sick\nGotta come here with me\n112\nWe can hit\nBody thick\nGon' be tripping with me", "image":
