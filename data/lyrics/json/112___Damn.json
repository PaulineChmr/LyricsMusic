Ohh ohhh\nDamn why'd you have to dress so flyy?\nWhy'd you have to catch my eye?\nOhh ohh won't somebody tell me why?\nDamn why'd I have to fall in love at a time when I knew I wasn't ready? ohh ohh\nWhy did I fall for you?\nWhy did I love her too?\nWhat was I suppose to do? ohh ohh\n\n[Chorus 1x]\nDamn now i never meant to break your heart no\nDamn and I never really meant to leave you alone babe\nDamn but i had to except that we were not happy\nI just wasn't working\n\n[Verse 2]\nDamn why'd you have to be so cool\nAt a time when me and ol' girl was having our problems? oh ohh\nDamn, why'd she have to be so cruel?\nWhy did I turn to you?\nDid I make the wrong move?\nDamn, why did you give me space?\nAt a time when that girl was trying to holla ohh\nDamn why'd u have to take her place?\nWhy'd did you have to stay?\nWhy was it too late for us?\n\n[Chorus 2x]\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaby I should let it go\nOr should I let her know\nI got another on the side and she does everything right\nI don't know what else to do, I'm not happy with you\n\nAs she steps in and everything I need she's giving me\nI can't believe just how good she is to me\nAnd i don't ever want her ever to stop cause I love her so much\nAll that i can say is\nDamn\n\n[Chorus until end]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/492a416e7636e175b1e2f6a6f689928e.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "112", "json":
