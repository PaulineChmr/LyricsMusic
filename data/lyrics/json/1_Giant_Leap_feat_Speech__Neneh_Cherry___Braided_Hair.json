{"songs": [{"title": "Braided Hair", "album": "1 Giant Leap", "year": "2001-04-02", "lyrics": "[Intro Speech]\nYeah? Yo we was talkin earlier and I was -I was tellin' you, I was talkin 'bout life\nAnd I.. I feel like life is really just like braided hair\nCause it's, it's got like twists, y'know, you know about braiding? Heh\nLike twists you know, three strands twist together\nUltimately you get to where you gonna get to, y'know\n\n[Verse 1: Speech]\nFrom the same dirt, from the hills of my ancestors\nThe naked rows and the fields where the pain festered\nI wonder where the hole came from\nIn the deeps of my heart, make me yearn for the drum\nIt's the same place where the cross is burned\nThe same place where the loss was earned\nIt's the place where the floss was yearned\nGold teeth and bling ice on the rings baby sure\n\n[Hook: Neneh Cherry + Speech]\nYo we all got things that hangin' about\nThings that make us cool, things that make us whack\nThings that make us mad, things we wish we never had... done\nBut they're just the things that make us real\nNot the maps to guide where we go from here\nThe road twists and braids like hair\nUntil we all get there\n\n[Verse 2: Speech]\nI like that I don't know some mysteries\nAncient things and beginnings\nExcited 'bout the day when I don't have to hear all the theories\nMy scalp needs some grease\nIn the same place where the cross is burned\nThe same place where the loss was earned\nThe only way we all can learn\nIs if we have these brais with the twists and turns\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Neneh Cherry]\nWalkin in the race of life, lookin for my own pace\nNot always wantin to, but I have to\nSometimes feelin like I've bitten off much more than I can chew\nBut the wind goes though my hair and lifts me up with ease, not a crease\nHair full of grease, no weave embracin' me; it's you I see\nI am you and you are me I see, yeah\n\n{*African chanting interlude*}\n\n[Neneh Cherry:]\nI am you and you are me I see, yeah\n\n[Speech + Neneh Cherry:]\nWe might survive as brothers yeah or perish here as fools\nGo place your bets; but don't bet too soon\nYeah you might find me in another, feels like someone you once knew\nYou know that face, yeah we all do", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b3a27b7a9a2cf5597cab1259c621035d.385x331x1.jpg",
