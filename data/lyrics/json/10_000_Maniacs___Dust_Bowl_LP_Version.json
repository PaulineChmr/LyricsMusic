Games, airplanes\nThey don't understand\nAnd how can i explain?\n\n[Chorus:]\nI try and try but i can't save\nPennies, nickels, dollars slip away\nI've tried and tried but i can't save\n\n[Verse 2:]\nMy youngest girl has bad fever, sure\nAll night with alcohol\nTo cool and rub her down\nRuby, i'm tired\nTry and get some sleep\nI'm adding doctor's fees to remedies\nWith the cost of\nThree day's work lost\n\n[Chorus 1:]\nI try and try but i can't save\nPennies, nickels, dollars slip away\nI've tried and tried but i can't save\nThe hole in my pocketbook is growing\n\n[Chorus 2:]\nThere's a new wind blowing they say\nIt's gonna be a cold, cold one\nSo brace yourselves my darlings\nIt won't bring anything much our way\nBut more dust bowl days\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI played a card\nIn this week's game\nTook the first and the last letters\nIn three of their names\nThis lottery's been building up for weeks\nI could be lucky me\nWith the five million prize\nTears of disbelief spilling out of my eyes\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\n[Chorus 2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7cbc1a76ee98ae0b90142dfc30866f37.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "10,000 Maniacs", "json": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path":
