swimmer?\nOnly a fool like me\n\nI've greased my body\nAnd I'm heading over the ocean\nThese two arms are the only locomotion\nI need\n\nSee me swim and see me float\nI don't need no motorboat\nOr a yacht to get me there\n\nI'll do the breaststroke\nAnd the backstroke\nI'll do anything\nI'll be swimming when you're all asleep\nI'll be swimming when you're all awake\nI'll do the sidestroke\nThe other sidestroke\nI'll do the butterfly\nBut I ain't gonna crawl\nOn back to you, no way\n\nI see your face in every breaker\nI see your smile across the reef\nI came across the sea to take you\nDon't make me out to be a thief\n\nYou'll be dreaming when you're all asleep\nBut I'll be drowning when you're all awake\nI did the breaststroke\nI did my best stroke\nI did everything\nBut I ain't good enough\n\n'Cause it's cold down here in the water\nIt's cold down here in the sea\nWho'd be a channel swimmer?\nOnly a fool like me\nWho'd be a channel swimmer?\nOnly a fool like me...\nWould forget he can't swim", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d4db60b82efa00b730ed50cec827a12c.294x300x1.jpg", "artist": "10cc", "json": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1430055", "apple_music_id":
