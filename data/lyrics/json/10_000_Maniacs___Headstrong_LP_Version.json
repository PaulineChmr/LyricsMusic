mind\nI mind my feelings and not your words\nDidn't you notice I'm so headstrong\nEven when I know I'm wrong?\nTake this to your heart and into your head now\nBefore you waste your time\nCall a truce and call a draw\nWhat's the use in mapping your views out in orderly form\nWhen it does nothing but confuse and anger me more?\nI mind my feelings and not your words\nDidn't you notice I'm so headstrong\nYou're talking to a deaf stone wall\n\n[Chorus:]\nTake this to your heart and into your head now\nThe old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it\nAll is fair in love and war\nThat's how the famous saying goes\n\n[Verse 2:]\nOpen up your eyes, see me for what I am\nCast in iron, I won't break and I won't bend\nTake this to your heart and into your head now\nThe old wives' tale is true, i'll repeat it\nAll is fair in love and war\nThat's how the famous saying goes\nIf I told you we were out to sea in a bottomless boat\nYou'd try anything to save us\nYou'd try anything to keep us afloat\nAnd if we were living in a house afire\nI don't believe that you could rush out and escape it\nAnd not rescue me\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro:]\nListen, I think they were talking to you", "image":
