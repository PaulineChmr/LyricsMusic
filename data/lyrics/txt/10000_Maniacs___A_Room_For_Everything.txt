Ooh

[Verse 1]
You were looking away from me
Western skies calling you
Color spilling, running, dazzling you
I was looking the other way
Voices call from the east
I saw my roots of the tree there planted at my feet

[Chorus]
It could be I'm searching
For a place so small
With room for everything
Where worlds on worlds revolve
But how can we wait?

I wouldn't hold you, no
I wouldn't hold you
I wouldn't hold you back

[Verse 2]
Suppose I was the clever one
And words came easy to me
I could say I was writing a song about you
You and me
Maybe the verse is yet to be found
But waits inside of me
A secret room, a tangled web to unweave

[Chorus]
It could be I'm searching
For a place so small
With room for everything
Where worlds on worlds revolve
But how can we wait?
Knowing our ways?
How can we hold on?
Still, you know it's not too late

I wouldn't hold you, no, I wouldn't hold you
I wouldn't hold you back
I wouldn't hold you, no, I wouldn't hold you
I wouldn't hold you back
I wouldn't hold you, no, I wouldn't hold you
I wouldn't hold you back
I wouldn't hold you, no, I wouldn't hold you
I wouldn't hold you back
