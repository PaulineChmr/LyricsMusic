[Verse 1]
Distance and space allow emotions to age into faith
Our bodies may end up alone but close

[Hook]
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

[Verse 2]
Just in the way all your fingertips touch me
They are healing
One day we'll all fall prey

[Hook]
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

[Verse 3]
Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fears of
Distance away (a weight) distance away

[Hook]
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me

[Outro]
Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fear love
