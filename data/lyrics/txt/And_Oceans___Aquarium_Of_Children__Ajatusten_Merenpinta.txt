Like stones in silence I stand
As I draw circles in the sand
Naked under blue glass
Drowned I watch children dance

In a mind of an echo

(I know that I am I, if and only if I
Believe that I am I)

I float to the distance to eat the horizon
I cut the sunbeams the day before tomorrow
Tranceform the time to a silent history
Run under water in eternal serenity

... Is it easy to run
To run under water?
... Is it easy to paint
To paint without colors?

I float to the distance to eat the horizon
I cut the sunbeams the day before tomorrow
Tranceform the time to a silent history
Run under water in eternal serenity

(If I would've been the other I
And if I would've wanted to be the other I
Then I could've been I)

... Is it easy to run
To run under water?
... Is it easy to paint
To paint without colors?

As an echo in the mind
