Ask you why must they die for your comfort compromise?
Ask you why must they die for your fancy flavored fillet prize?
Killed and bred, blood runs red, so you can gratify what's already dead
Homeless cry, hungry die, while your flesh kitchens touch the sky

Ashes/Dust, your body belongs to the fire

Ask you why must they die for your comfort compromise?
Scream for bread, underfed, I won't inherit your empty eyes
Compromise, compromise, my soul I will not compromise

A corporate sponsored genocide with a happy meal
Created to gloss over the hundreds of millions dead while around the world so many mourn the loss of a life not yet lived and daily I am left staring at their message neatly displayed on the side of trucks claiming "All life is sacred."
Yet do their actions show that all life is sacred?
Or just those that entail no sacrifice of their own, ignoring the callous and unnecessary murder represented in their three perfect meals a day?
