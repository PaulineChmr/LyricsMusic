Just for the record
You ought to know that I love you
Because the damage that you've done
I know you still could do

So fun time is over
And I guess it's enough
Oh, but just for the record
It was a little too rough

All that night when I looked for you
Without a word to say
Knowing that I was looking through
The longest night, the longest day

Sleeping and waking
Is the hardest thing to do
When you are taking
Every dream I had of you
Sleeping and waking

Tell me what love is
Or rather what you expected
Because I've often wondered
What you did not get

When all through the town I
Heard your heart beating wrong, I
Felt the sickness come on, I
Knew that you were gone

So now I'm left with an empty bed
What a place to stay
Saying things that were never said
Through the longest night, the longest day

Sleeping and waking
Is the hardest thing to do
When you are taking
Every dream I had of you

Sleeping and waking
Sleeping and waking
Sleeping and waking
Makes the longest night
The longest night
The longest night
The longest day
