[Verse 1]
Cherish
Two circular hues of blue with a gray shade
So captivating
More than you know
False perceptions
That brought forth these questions of
Truth, love and hope
Now that you're injuring
I'll carry you with me just
Please hold on

[Hook]
Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse
Through your iris

[Verse 2]
Love's not all lost
But it's nailed to my cross
And crucified all that I've held on
To be awaiting
Anticipating a touch such as yours
False affection
A spawn of neglecting
Of love, lust, hoax
Please understand me
That now where you're standing
Is closer then I'd hoped

[Hook x3]
