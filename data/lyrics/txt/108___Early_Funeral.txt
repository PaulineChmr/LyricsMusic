Your moment fades away the setting sun seems to say
Those lonely shadows cross your mind
Your treasures gone and there are no more to find

Now you're old
Are you tired and sore?
Does your soul even work anymore?

Your moon has grown cold, it's dim and gray
Saturn's grief is in your hear, holding sway
There's so much sadness locked away
Your moment fades away

Now you're old, all you see is lines
In your hands, on your face, in your mind
Can your thoughts still feel the sky?
Or does your soul make you want to die?

Cry
Die, it's time to die
Dead
