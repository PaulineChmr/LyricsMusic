You don’t know me, sorry about the note
But I’m the one who bought your daddy’s boat
You could love me, baby, try and see
I’ll take you sailing around the world with me

People spending all their lives to die
A silver sparkle in their tired eyes
There’s a whole world out there to explore
And what’d you take all those French lessons for?

Who’s the one who brought you to the point?
Who’s the one who taught you how to roll a joint?
Can you tell me?
I have nothing left to give, don’t even try
Sailing around the world with a funky guy

Who’s the one who brought you to the point?
Who’s the one who taught you how to roll a joint?
Can you tell me?
I have nothing left to give, don’t even try
Sailing around the world with a funky guy

Fall with me
Come with me
Cling for dear life to a ship upon an angry sea

Who’s the one who brought you to the point?
Who’s the one who taught you how to roll a joint?
Can you tell me?
I have nothing left to give, don’t even try
Sailing around the world with a funky guy
