I was winding my clock
Which was waking us up
In the morning, we were laughing
Away like fools

I was saying my prayers
He was combing his hair
In a country that began with a
'J' for Jules

You know I'll miss you
And thus it begins
But I'll release you
And thus it continues -
Someday we'll be happy again

Oh, the rain never comes
Count my blessings on my thumbs
And the dogs just want to sleep in the
Sun all day

You know I'll miss you
And thus it begins
But I'll release you
And thus it continues
Someday we'll be happy again

There's no way a country like that could die
Told me that they drift away
But that's a lie

Well, I just bought a car
But it stays in the yard
And the country that began with a 'J'
Now ends in my heart

You know I'll miss you
And thus it begins
But I'll release you
And thus it continues
Someday we'll be happy again

Someday we'll be happy again
Someday we'll be happy again
