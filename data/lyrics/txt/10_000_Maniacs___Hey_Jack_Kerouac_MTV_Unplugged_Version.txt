( Robert Buck/Natalie Merchant )

Hey Jack Kerouac, I think of your mother
And the tears she cried, they were criedfor none other
Than her little boy lost in our little world that hated
And that dared to drag him down, her little boy courageous
Who chose his words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood
Hip flask slinging madman, steaming cafe flirts
They all spoke through you

Hey Jack, now for the tricky part
When you were the brightest star, who were the shadows?
Of the San Francisco beat boys you were the favorite
Now they sit and rattle their bones and think of their blood stoned days
You chose your words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood
The hip flask slinging madman, steaming cafe flirts
In Chinatown howling at night

Allen baby, why so jaded?
Have the boys all grown up and their beauty faded?
Billy, what a saint they've made you
Just like Mary down in Mexico on All Souls' Day

You chose your words from mouths of babes got lost in the wood
Cool junk booting madmen, street minded girls
In Harlem, howling at night
What a tear stained shock of the world
You've gone away without saying goodbye
