[Verse 1]
Keep changing your mind
Like clouds in the sky
Love me when your high
Leave me when you cry
I know it all takes time
Like a river running dry when the sun's too bright

[Hook]
So long this is good-bye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see clearly in a different light

[Verse 2]
Keep dodging lights
Like a thief in the night
The sun will rise and expose all our lies
So why deny that you and I lead different lives
The rivers from your eyes can't change my mind

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Oh...
The rivers from your eyes can't change my mind

[Hook]
