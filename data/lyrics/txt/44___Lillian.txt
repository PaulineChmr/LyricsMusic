[Verse]
The place I used to live made me feel like a tourist
I couldn't coexist with the cold and suspicious
When the last remaining light was starting to filter
It seemed the perfect time to step into the future

[Chorus]
Your heart is a grave to be perfectly honest
Your mouth's a smoking gun
And you smile while you're twisting the knife in my stomach
Until everything is gone
Take all you can from me
I've got weak constitution
I'm led so easily
So easily

[Verse]
I left it all behind in the dead of last winter
I left it all behind but the question still lingers
So long, forgotten friends, no, you don't know the difference
Between love and submission, and I'm not that obedient

[Chorus]
Your heart is a grave to be perfectly honest
Your mouth's a smoking gun
And you smile while you're twisting the knife in my stomach
Until everything is gone
Take all you can from me
I've got weak constitution
I'm led so easily
So easily

[Bridge]
And she's trying to sleep it off
With her head on my shoulder
And I'm trying to keep it out
Of my thoughts when I hold her (Take all you can from me)
And she's trying to sleep it off
With her head on my shoulder (I'm led so easily)
And I'm trying to keep it out
Of my thoughts when I hold her

[Chorus]
Your heart is a grave to be perfectly honest
Your mouth's a smoking gun
And you smile while you're twisting the knife in my stomach
Until everything is gone
Take all you can from me
I've got weak constitution
I'm led so easily
So easily
