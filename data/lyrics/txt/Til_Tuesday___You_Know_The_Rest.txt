(It's in F#)

Here I go again
Making promises
If I tell you no
It still sounds like yes

You know the rest
Do I have to say it?

Am I in too deep?
Can I still confess?
-when you trusted me
That was just a guess

I guess
You know the rest
You know the rest
Do I have to say it?

Well, I warned you once
But without success
And I just escape
With my heart
A mess

Know the rest
(it's not so easy)
You know the rest
(its not that easy)
Do I have to say it?
You know the rest
