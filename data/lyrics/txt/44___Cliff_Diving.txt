[Verse 1]
Hey silly girl, I think I got a thing for you
From late nights spent driving in this stolen car
The years we wasted living in this desert town
Haven't broken us so far
Hot afternoons we climbed onto the neighbor's house
Breathed deep and jumped into a waiting sky
Our bare feet were framed on the horizon
I felt the future in your eyes

[Chorus]
It was the promise of summer
We sealed it with a kiss
This time I'll do things proper
How did it get to this?

[Verse 2]
Dear you, tonight lets get ahead of ourselves
'Cause now, I barely can remember
Yesterday stretched on for so long
Tomorrow feels like forever
My God, you know how much I needed this
These days are filled with such disaster
Sometimes I think that life will never be the same
Sometimes I think that's the answer

And she said

[Chorus]
It was the promise of summer
We sealed it with a kiss
This time I'll do things proper
How did we get to this?
Here comes the promise of summer
We sealed it with a kiss
This time I'll do things proper
How do we get to this?
Here comes the promise of summer
We sealed it with a kiss
This time I'll do things proper
How did we get to this?
Here comes the promise of summer
We sealed it with a kiss
This time I'll do things proper
How did we get to this?

[Outro]
Here comes the promise of summer
Let's seal it with a kiss
Let's seal it with a kiss
Let's seal it with a kiss
Here comes the promise of summer
How did we get to this?
