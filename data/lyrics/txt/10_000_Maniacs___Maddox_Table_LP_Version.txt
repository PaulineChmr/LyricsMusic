The legs of maddox kitchen tables
My whole life I twisted on a lathe
In a foreman's torrent
My first english was
"faster boy if you want your pay"
Barking commands
Loud and simple
We could all obey
Then i was forever pulling slivers
Rubbed the sawdust always
Deeper in my eye
Varnish vapor that could linger
On my skin
It held tight
The whine of spinning blades
Still echoes to bother my sleep at night

[Chorus:]
See that oxen
Stamped dead center
On the letter head of the company mail
For decades, a spitting image
Of the animal, I portrayed
At maddox table a yoke was carved
For my neck

[Verse 2:]
Sun through the window oil spattered
And in mason jars
Tricked plenty seeds to thrive
The standing joke
Around the shop
Was with my green thumb
Anything'd grow
My part was to laugh
Show an ornery jig had
Cut it at the knuckle bone

[Chorus:]
See that oxen
Trade mark burned
Into every stick of furniture
From horn to tail
For decades, a spitting image
Of the animal, I portrayed
At maddox table a yoke was carved
For my neck
Was tailor made

[Verse 3:]
Oh, my Dolly was a weak
Not a burdened girl
Treat her to a piece of vaudeville
A Wintergarden moving picture show
Bemus Point on July Sundays
By trolley we'd go
To your benefit we'll strike a bargain
With the waving fist of a union man
Not just for
Smokes
Spirits
Candy and cologne
But for
Automobile keys
Cash in the bank
And the deed
On a place called home
