[Chorus 1:]
Wide open falsehood
The clandestine truths
Rival till the end
In a series of duels
Pardon the drapery language i choose

[Verse 1:]
"Waltz in vienna" has taught me to use
Every tall room a fiction
Leather bound treasure books
Up to the ceiling
Gold spine upon spine
The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2:]
The author grew fat to imagine
His lead pen careening
Gave voice to the scheming
An aryan cabal to dethrone

[Chorus 2:]
The guile and the treason
The faith and allegiance
To the empire unknown

[Verse 3:]
The baron and his mistress
Dine in fine banquet hall
As rebel insurgents plot in
The attic space crawl

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4:]
His small hand did strive
To explain all the
Rants and raves of
A people enslaved
By the can't of the shrewdest
Capable men

[Chorus 2][x2]
