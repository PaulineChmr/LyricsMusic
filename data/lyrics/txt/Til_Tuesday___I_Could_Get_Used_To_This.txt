So far-
Or should I take it just a little farther
So good-
And if I think about it, it gets better
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to
Feeling the way that I do
So long-
Or should I stay just a little longer
So much
For keeping it a secret
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to
Feeling the way that I do
Oh, all the times I told myself
I could never fall in love
Love is just too difficult
Oh, too bad
I'm only talking to myself about it
So sad-
I guess I'm going to have to live without
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to
Feeling the way that I do
I know, I know, I know how it goes
Baby, will I get the chance?
I could get used to
Feeling the way that I do
