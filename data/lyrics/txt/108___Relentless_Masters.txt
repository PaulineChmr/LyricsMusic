Relentless masters, capitalism, countless hours, surrendered to you
Enslave (my) being, my intellect, (you'd) slit my throat if it produced (more) profits
Filthy hunt, for control
Divert attention through fear
Mass create, dumb down, tune out, the destruction of man

Burn

One less passive consumer
One less ugly statistic
One less countless pawn
One less gear in the killing machine
