Til Tuesday
Voices Carry
Don't Watch Me Bleed
I guess you gave as good as you got
I guess this love is dead at last
But I paid such a lot
The price you pay for living under glass
So don't just kiss me goodbye
That's not what I need
Don't just kiss me goodbye
Don't watch me bleed
You tried to keep me in my place
Said it was love that kept me there
How could you lie right to my face?
And smile at me-and sound so sincere-
So don't just kiss me goodbye
That's not what I need
Don't just kiss me goodbye
Don't watch me bleed
Don't just kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
That's not what I need
Don't just kiss me goodbye
Don't watch me bleed
