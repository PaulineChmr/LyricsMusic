I'm a naked sun see right through me
I'm a naked sun
I have no clouds to conceal me
I have not one
Maybe someday I'll forget
To rise up but it hasn't happened yet
I've got you sunburnt now
In the morning rise up to greet me
And say I'm number one
In the evening cry when I'm leaving
And the day is done
Maybe someday I'll confess
A love once warm gone cold like all the rest
I've got you sunburnt now
I'm a naked sun see right through me
I'm a naked sun
I'm not the moon you thought you left me
So bright have I become
Maybe someday I'll accept
Your faults, till then I'll curse the day that we met
I've got you sunburnt now
I'll burn a way out
