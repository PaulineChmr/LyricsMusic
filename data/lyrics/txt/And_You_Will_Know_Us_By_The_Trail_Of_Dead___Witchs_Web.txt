Told a lie about yourself
It felt so good to decieve
You pulled the wool over everyone
Told them whatever they'd believe

You missed the train and now you're gone
To join the faceless everyone
You're a name on a phone list I've crossed off
I've pushed you back to square one

And if I fall then I'll stand back up
Because learning how to run is half the fun
Somehow I know that there must be something better
No one's gonna have power over me

If there's a sign above the door (over you)
That says you have to hang your coat
But you're wanting me to pay the doorman with my soul
I think that I'll be moving on

Your witch's web is hanging over my sleep
My one half lies awake, the other in a dream
Somehow I know that there must be something better
No one's gonna have power over me
