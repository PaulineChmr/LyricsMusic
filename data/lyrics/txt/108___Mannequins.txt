Mannequins in groups of three?
To reassure you, to feel set free from your deep self-doubt and vacancy
From the sea of nothing that you plan to be

Moving, posing, breathing, dying, believing, walking straight to the sea

Undigestible, I trouble you, I trouble you
Confused by image, hypocrisy?
Yet I am Satan and Jesus too
Yes I am nothing; but not like you

Moving, posing, breathing, dying, believing, walking straight to the sea
