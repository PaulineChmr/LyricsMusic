[Chorus 1:][x2]
Like a weasel in the clover
You tilt toss pop turn over
Sit down
Tremble and weave like a moth
By flame deceived
Sit down

[Verse 2:]
Spill with your words caught up dance in your room
Slide like you're buttered up roll back the tomb sit down

[Chorus 2:]
When the thunderclouds sound
Ants scatter to high ground
Sit down

[Chorus 3:][x2]
Bolt scuff jilt chase circle riddle
Shake in haste
Sit down

[Chorus 2]
