It's goin down tonight...

Baby I love the way, you're
Lookin at me, lookin at me
You're so amazing, you gotta
Give it to me, give it to me
You touch, every single part of me
I'll touch, every single part of you
I wanna make sure that you're
Gonna wanna come back for more

Baby I can tell, you're
Feelin me, feelin me
Your bodies callin
What's your fantasy, fantasy
You touch, every single part of me
I'll touch, every single part of you
Hey girl stop playin games
And meet me at the door

Do you wanna get down...

[Chorus]
Do you wanna get down
Do you wanna get down tonight
You can bring your own girl if you like
Don't be scared girl, I won't bite
Cause I'm gonna bring it out of you
All the freaky things inside of you
It's going down tonight
I said it's goin down tonight
Yes, Yes, it's goin down tonight

Girl when we meet, you're a
Regular girl, regular girl
Takin you to places, you've never
Been before, been before

You'll do, freaky things I like
I'm gonna make sure that you're
Gonna wanna come back for more

Let's try to keep this, between
Me and you, me and you
No need to tell, unless we're
Coming to, coming to
We'll do, freaky things tonight
We'll do, freaky things I like
So girl stop playin games
And meet me at the door

Oh baby, baby...

[Chorus]

Hey yo
Shakin that body like it's, Jell-o
Shorty bout to make the twelve lose control
We all up in the club like, ayo
Workin like a stripper like, oh woo oh
Come and take a sip of that, oh woo oh
She's all over me like, oh woo oh
In the V.I.P im like do it baby, shake it baby, drop it baby, shake it baby
Yah, yah, yah, yah

[T.I]
Peel to the T in the V.I.P
Everybody drinkin in the bar on me
I spot a group of ladies with they eyes on me
And I ain't gotta pick one, I can have all three
Like, whats happenin ladies, I was seein you choosin
Can't help but thinkin of you 3 in the noonin
Let's skip the game, cut that out of confusion
Im tired of talking over all this loud music
Now let's go somewhere where we all can lose it
Listened to my offer and they couldn't refuse it
Got in the two do, started cruisin
We blew dro and they started removing
They wardrobe, they topless now
About 2 of those is poppin now
Touch here, kiss there, no stoppin now
She licked there and got her underwear broughten down

Oh baby...

[Chorus X2]
