(He) talk(s) about God like his head holds more
Than television and cobwebs
She broadcast(s) “her God” on the back of her car
Like some national anthem, pack mentality
Is it a football religion? A bumper-sticker crusade?

She fears “her God” like she feared her parents?
He fears the deep end of his shallow life

Get the fuck away from me, I just want to be in love
