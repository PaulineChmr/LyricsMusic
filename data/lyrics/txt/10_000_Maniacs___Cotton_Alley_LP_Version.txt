[Verse:]
One time
You made me cry
Be proud that i
Remember
My chin is sore
The bruise is gone
But the spot is tender
Gave my hand
A sister coy
To cotton alley where
You did enjoy
Your wicked games
You curious boy
Tied my laces up together
When i fell
You laughed
Until your belly was sore
In the brick laid aisle behind
The five and dime store
That's how
I made you blush
But doubt if you
Remember
Were my tears genuine
Or those of a skilled
Pretender?
Nothing precious
Plain to see
Don't make a fuss over me
Not loud
Not soft
But somewhere in between
Say "sorry"
Let it be the word you mean
I was a little pest who
Never took a hint
Could never take a hint
You pinched my fingers
In a door
Tossed my coloring book in a
Rusty barrel
Pulled spiders from my hair
Fingers in the door
My favorite blue blouse
Stained on the back
Running from a berry war
Can you hear me scream
In cotton alley?
