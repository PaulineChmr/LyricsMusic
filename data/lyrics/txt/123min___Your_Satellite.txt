Your Satellite is showing you're in trouble
Do you feel all right?
All the stories I'd have for you
If I could find a way to turn back time
In your life, there are ones like you
Who made it out alive
All the words we said that we'd soon forget
Didn't mean a thing in the end
A mother cries. If you hear my words
Show me and close your eyes
Oh and what I would give to speak
Or maybe have responded to you that night
The situation doesn't leave much room
For a compromise
Till you wake up, I won't let go
Wake up and give them a show

Take the road to the very end

Your Satellite is showing childhood friends
Under a different light
Do you question my welcome here?
Sometimes I wonder late at night

Take the road to the very end
Take the road to the very end, no turning back again
To the very end

Your Satellite is showing you're in trouble
Do you feel all right?
It's not your kind
Now your walls are down as if you've lost your mind
Satellite. Don't wanna see you move into the other life
It's like the ones we love, we soon forget
I won't ever forget again

Take the road to the very end
To the very end
