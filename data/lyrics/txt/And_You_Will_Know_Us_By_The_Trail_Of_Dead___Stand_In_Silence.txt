I had a house on a rock
I turned around and it had gone to rot
All that was left of me were walls of doubt
I asked a question but the world returned with silence
All that I wanted to know is where'd everyone else go?

I had a dad, and a mom
I had a family, don't know what went wrong
I watched them helpless as their blood turned sour
Wanted to speak for them but had to stand in silence
All that I wanted to know is where'd everyone else go?

I had a band, had a song
I had a vision, where's my vision gone?
I turned inside to find the walls of doubt
My mind was stripped of sound, I had to stand in silence
All that I wanted to know is where'd everyone else go?
