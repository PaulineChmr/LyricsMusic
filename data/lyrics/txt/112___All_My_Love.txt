When I look into your eyes I see you're lonely
Won't you come with me
I wanna know from you
If ever you needed someone
Could you call on me
Let me touch you, let me hold you
Let me squeeze you
Give your love to me
Baby, stop wasting time
And let's get together, baby

[Chorus:]
Let me show you
Can I get to know you
Baby let me give you
All my love
[repeat]

Let me touch the secret places known to no one
What's your fantasy
I'm giving you all of me
I wanna please you 'till you can't take it no more
Can I take you to a place where no one finds you
Let's forget about time
It's all about you and me, oh
Can we get together, baby

[Chorus]
When I'm with you something takes control of me
When we're together, can't you see it's destiny
When I'm near you it feels like you're a part of me
And baby I don't want you to go away from me, no

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
