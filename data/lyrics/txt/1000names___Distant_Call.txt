Waking the sun on a cold winter morn
My lonesome steps roam on the frost kissed shore
Cry of a gull piercing my heart I hear a distant call

Smell of the breeze carries sweet springtime dreams
Song of the sea: crystal bells ring with glee
Free like a gull through open skies sail to the distant...

Somewhere away
Far 'cross the waves
Lies a land
Welcoming port
Shelter of hopes
Meet you there

Farewell, this world: my old cell built on rock
I leave now behind all the fears, all the woe
Deep lust for life fills up my heart feeling the distance...
