[Verse 1:]
Hey jack kerouac
I think of your mother
And the tears she cried, she cried for none other
Than her little boy lost in our little world that hated
And that dared to drag him down
Her little boy courageous

[Chorus:]
Who chose his words from mouths of
Babes got lost in the wood
Hip flask slinging madman, steaming cafe flirts
They all spoke through you

[Verse 2:]
Hey jack
Now for the tricky part
When you were the brightest star
Who were the shadows?
Of the san francisco beat boys
You were the favorite
Now they sit and rattle their bones
And think of their blood stoned days

[Chorus:]
You chose your words from mouths of
Babes got lost in the wood
The hip flask slinging madman, steaming cafe flirts
Nights in chinatown howling at night

[Verse 3:]
Allen baby, why so jaded
Have the boys all grown up and their beauty faded?
Billy, what a saint they've made you
Just like mary down in mexico on all souls' day

[Chorus:]
You chose your words from mouths of
Babes got lost in the wood
Cool junk booting madmen, street minded girls
In harlem howling at night

[Outro:]
What a tear stained shock of the world
You've gone away without saying
Saying goodbye
