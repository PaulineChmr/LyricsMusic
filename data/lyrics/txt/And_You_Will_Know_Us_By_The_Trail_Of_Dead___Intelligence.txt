Eyes obscured, by those bangs
Sun is shielded, by your shades
Kick it on the corner
Leather coat and safety pins
You got some [?] News
And you smoke your [?] Cools
And it's 1977

77

You were rocking out of town
Will last night ring in your ears?
(With last night ringing in your ears)
Kids are hopped up now
They are ready to go

In this burned out, shell of a place
Eveyone, everybody, hustles around
They were looking for that faraway/fiery court
To make this troubled sound

You were rocking out of town
Will last night ring in your ears?
(With last night ringing in your ears)
Kids are hopped up now
They are ready to go

You said they'd hate you first
But now they're coming 'round
You said you were a curse
But now your look has changed
