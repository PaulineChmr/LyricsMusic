[Verse 1:]
She borders the pavement
Flanks avenues
Parades pass
White glove attended by
My mother the war
She'll raise a shaft
Lift a banner
Toss a rose

[Chorus]
Mother the war
Mother the war
Mother the war
Mother the war

[Verse 2:]
She knows every neighbor
Chats at their doors
Compare
Econo-size electric appliances
Mother the war
Come share tea
And a seat by my
Cradle with

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Forsaken vigil
Three years each tour
Hands of god enfold him
Prayed mother the war
Haunt a doorway
Beg a postman
Is there word

[Chorus]
For mother the war
My mother the war
Mother

[Verse 4:]
5 black stars
In bitter defiance
She's spiting the corps
Wet a brood
Short league for combat
Mother the war
Well acquainted
With sorrow
With grief

[Chorus]
Mother the war
Mother the war

[Verse 5:]
Folded lace
Carrion
Blood soaked robes
Folded lace
Carrion
Blood soaked
Shroud

[Chorus]
My mother the war
My mother
Mother
Mother
Mommy
