It was you, it was me, it was love, it was real, then we touched
Then we kissed, then we loved da way it feels, it was
Time to spend together leaving all da world behind n I thought it would last
But only time would tell so I waited on time

How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes
It was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you
And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth

Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me
I can't understand da reason, why you, why you
Wanna play me, you said, you would never me said
You always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you wanna play me

We were real, we were chill you would tell me how you feel you wanted me
You needed me da only one to ease your mind I was
Caught by surprise to hear you say you wanna leave
But it's cool if you gotta go then go ahead n leave imma be around

How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes it
Was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you
And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth

[2x] Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me
I can't understand da reason, why you, why
You wanna play me, you said, you would never me said
You always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you wanna play me

[2x] We used to be in love and we used to be so good you used to drive me so crazy
That was da time you was loving me like you should back when you were my baby

[2x] Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me
I can't understand da reason, why you, why
You wanna play me, you said, you would never me said
You always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you wanna play me
