[Chorus:]
The painted desert
Can wait till summer
We've played this game of just imagine long enough
Wait till summer?

[Verse 1:]
When i'm sure the rains have ended
The blooms have gone
Everyone killed by the morning frost
Is a cactus blooming there
In every roadside stand
Where the big deal is cowboy gear
Sewn in japan?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
When i'm sure the rains have ended
The blooms have gone
Everyone killed by the morning frost
Is a cactus blooming there
Upon the northern rim
Or in the ruins of the hopi mesa dens?
You met a new friend in the canyon
(or so you wrote)
On a blanket in the cooling sand
You and your friend agreed that
The stars were so many there
They seemed to overlap

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
When i am sure the rain has ended
The blooms have gone
Everyone killed by the morning frost
Was a cactus blooming there
As you watched the native boy?
In flagstaff trailer court, you wrote the line
"he kicked a tumbleweed
And his mother called him home
Where the arizona moon
Met the arizona sun"
I wanted to be there by may at the latest time
Isn't that the plan we had or have you changed your mind?
I haven't read a word from you since pheonix or tucson
April is over, will you tell me how long
Before i can be there?
