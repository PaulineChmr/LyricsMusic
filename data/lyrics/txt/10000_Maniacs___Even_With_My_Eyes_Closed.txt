[Verse 1]
Even with my eyes closed
Funny how I know
It's harder, it's harder now
Young girl, in my young girl days
Thinking I could live for always

[First Chorus]
But like an ocean tide
I'm drawn back inside
And I know

[Verse 2]
Seasons pass like sand inside a glass
And nothing, nothing returns
Standing with the friends I've made
I'll race them to the grave
Well who won, who won the extra days?

[Second Chorus]
But like an ocean tide
I'm drawn back inside
Like an ocean tide
(Oh oh oh)
I'm drawn back inside
And I know

[Bridge]
When you take away the years toll
On the waters wide, shallow high and low
In the autumn sky
Happy to know I'm going home

[Reprise]
Even with my eyes closed
Funny how I know
It's finally
Has it finally begun?

[Third Chorus]
Ocean tide
(Oh oh oh)
I'm drawn back inside
But like an ocean tide
(Oh oh oh)
I'm drawn back inside
And I know
Oh, and I know
And I know
