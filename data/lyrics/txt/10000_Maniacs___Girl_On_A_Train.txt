[Verse 1]
Waking on a train dreaming
Charmed alone they started speaking
Captured in his artist way
Before the memories fade away

[Chorus]
To remember a face
Oh, oh and you're home or want to

[Verse 2]
Certain they would meet soon
Paint a portrait of a family

[Chorus]
To remember a face
Oh, oh and you're home

[Bridge]
Single light on
Single way
Single light
Away

[Chorus]
To remember a face
Oh, oh and you're home
The night fell

[Verse 3]
Saw a painting on a stairwell
To mourn the passing of a daughter dear
Her soul upon the train so far so near

[Chorus]
To remember a face
Oh, oh and you're home

[Bridge]
Single light on
Single way
Single light
Away

Single light on
Single way
And oh, oh and you're home

[Outro]
Just close your eyes
And you're home
Just give me time
And you're home
Oh, oh and you're home
Oh, oh and you're home
Home
