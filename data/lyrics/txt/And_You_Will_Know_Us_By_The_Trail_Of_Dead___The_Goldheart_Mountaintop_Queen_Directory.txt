Cold hands touching my face
Don't hide the snake can see you
Old friends you might not remember
Fading away from you
Gold heart mountain top queen directory
The gold heart mountain top queen directory
And we looked
And we passed
Through the hallway of shatterproof glass
She runs through the night as if nobody cares
She screams and she hides and ignores all their stares
She wants me to come, but I'm never going there
The gold heart mountain top queen directory
(Gold heart mountain top, gold heart mountain top, gold heart mountain top)
The gold heart mountain top queen directory
