T.V. is enough
It is providing artificial friends
And relatives for lonely people
What it is is recurrent families
The same friends and relatives come back
Week after week after week after week
And they're wittier and they're better looking
And they're much more interesting and they're richer
Than your real friends and relatives
Where is the love from birth
Where it's gone
Where is the love for humanity
Where it's gone
The love for the children
Respect for the elders
Where it's gone
Where it's gone
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
When will they get it right
And live in the light
Rest in the city
Grace for the nightfall
Rewash my memory
Turn climb my great wall
Peace don't desert me
Not in the forest
Grace where I trespass
Calling my goddess
This is not real
Here is not now
Why do you seek
All that is?
Where is the love from birth
Where it's gone
Where is the love for humanity
Where it's gone?
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Tell me
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Tell me
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Dream my grandfather
Dream of great quiet
Barely a flash between
Words and blue silence
Gentle this hour
Wet is the highway
Brave are these cowards
Racing, racing, racing, racing away
Racing, racing, racing, racing away
Racing away
This is not real
