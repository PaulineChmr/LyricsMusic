Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways

Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the Senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free

Hey sis one kiss and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed
Milton's Paradise Lost
Could be found?

But in the eyes of the Dean his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's got to do
What a man's got to do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter, and me

They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered "I love you -
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol awol awol"

And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses

Now, the paint is peeling
Now, and when the chips are dowin
Now, you kinda lose all feeling
Now, your head goes round and round
Round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
I'm throwing myself off this train

Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways
Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways
Hum drum days, he's got
Hum drum ways, oh boy

Hey, you know I'm really earning now
My ship came in with a cargo of dollars
My name's lit up on the prow
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in dollars
Rolling in dollars
Rolling in dollars
Now
