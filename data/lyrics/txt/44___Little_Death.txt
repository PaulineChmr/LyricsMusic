[Verse 1]
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
The cry for inspiration never reaches ears on distant stars
And every night our lonely planet slides across the universe
And I won't pretend I understand...

[Verse 2]
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
Your death by information won't disturb the peace on distant stars
And Even when you lock the door and slide behind the unlit shades
None of us are strangers anymore

[Chorus]
So fall asleep with the windows open
Come to me with the worst you've said and done
You'll close your eyes and see me
(Little death makes life more meaningful)
I stand no chance at all

[Verse 3]
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
Your car crash in slow-motion won't upset the pace on distant stars
And one by one the years of our lives stumble as the moments pass
So please hold on... please hold on...

[Chorus]
So fall asleep with the windows open
Come to me with the worst you've said and done
You'll close your eyes and see me
(Little death makes life more meaningful)
I stand no chance at all
Please sleep my darling, sleep
Please sleep my darling, sleep

[Chorus]
So fall asleep with the windows open
Come to me with the worst you've said and done
You'll close your eyes and see me
(Little death makes life more meaningful)
I stand no chance at all
