In conclusion Ladies and Gentleman
A New World is emerging
It is a New World Order
A new World Order
A new World Order

We're running out of time
When will we ever learn
History repeats itself
The people always get burned

We're running out of time
We'd betta kill em first
I'm not fuckin around
I'll cut that fucker down

Bloodfire Bloodfire

Hit em back [x5]

What will it take for you to wake the fuck up?

Can't you see they're comin for
You, Poisoning you
Programming you?
And you don't even know it

Don't you wanna fight for your
Life and you family?
And end this fuckin insanity?

We're running out of time
When will we ever learn
History repeats itself
The people always get burned

We're running out of time
We'd betta kill em first
I'm not fuckin around
I'll cut that fucker down

Hit em back [x5]

One by one the sheep start to realize
Two by two we expose this world of lies
Be a man - Fight for the right to exist
Grab you gun and load the clip 'nigga'

No, him not badda den me
No, dem not badda den we
We the family

No, him not badda den me
No, dem not badda den we
We the family

We're running out of time
When will we ever learn
History repeats itself
The people always get burned

We're running out of time
We'd betta kill em first
I'm not fuckin around
I'll cut that fucker down

Bloodfire Bloodfire

We've got some difficult days ahead
But it really doesn't matter with me now
Because i've been to the mountain top
I don't mind
I've seen the promised land
I may not get there with you but I want you to know tonight
That we as a people will get to the promised land

We've got some difficult days ahead [x5]
