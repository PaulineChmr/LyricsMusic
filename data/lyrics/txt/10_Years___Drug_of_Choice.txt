Sex always sells
Death is a thrill
Imitate my lack of patience
How much we pay to be tailor made
Fashion slaves the trends will change

Now what is your drug of choice
Pick your poison and enjoy
Now what is your drug of choice
Pick your poison and enjoy

Disasterbation the thrill of a nation
Temptation is for sale
Disasterbation the death of a nation
Manipulate yourself

Reality scripted tv
Chasing fifteen minutes of fame
Fight over fuel
Violence in school
The youth are as confused as I am

Now what is your drug of choice
Pick your poison and enjoy
Now what is your drug of choice
Pick your poison and enjoy

Disasterbation the thrill of a nation
Temptation is for sale
Disasterbation the death of a nation

We're so weak for
Blaming persuastion
Live a life based
On imitation
On imitation
On imitation

So what is your drug of choice
Pick your poison and enjoy

Disasterbation the thrill of a nation
Temptation is for sale
