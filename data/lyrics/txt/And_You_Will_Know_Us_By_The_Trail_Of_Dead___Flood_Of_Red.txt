[Verse 1]
Follow you into this suicide
Place a foot into this city of refuge
Carelessly mock those around us who laugh and cry
Carefully lock those fears, surround them with lies

[Chorus]
From what I know
Can it do harm?
From one deadly sin
A burn to my skin

[Verse 2]
Blaze the underbelly with no remorse
Kiss the placid face of this frozen lake
Taken by the screaming rhetoric
Follow you into this suicide

[Chorus]
From what I know
Can it do harm?
From one deadly sin
A burn to my skin

[Chorus]
From what I know
Can it do harm?
From one deadly sin
A burn to my skin

[Outro]
A flood of red
Bound by lust
From what I know
Bound by lust
Bound by trust
