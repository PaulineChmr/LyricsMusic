There was a time
You opened up every doorway
You didn't mind if everything
Wasn't your way
Don't pull away
That goes against what you told me
I look in your eyes
I realize what you've sold me

Is love in a vacuum
Love in a vacuum

I think you've changed
But you insist that
That's not true
You look so strange, so distant
That you're hardly you
Now I can see
How you have been acting different
You say it's me
But I know
That it isn't
It's love in a vacuum
Love in a vacuum
And that's not enough
Love in a vacuum
You will be lonely
You'll be the only one who feels this way
You will be lonely
If you leave me alone
You will be lonely
You'll be the only one who feels this way
It's just not enough
And just wait
You will be lonely
Love in a vacuum
Love in a vacuum
And that's not enough
Love in a vacuum
