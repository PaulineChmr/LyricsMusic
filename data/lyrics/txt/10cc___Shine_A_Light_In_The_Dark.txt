I've been lost before and i had to pay
It was never easy but i found a way
Well the journey was hard and the road was tough
There were times when i cried lord i've had enough
Please don't desert me now
Don't you leave me stranded now i need a friend
Please don't desert me now
You've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless
Show me mercy when i'm helpless
Shine a light in the dark
Hold me back when i get reckless
Shine a light in the dark
Stand me up if i get legless
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
I've been down and out and i've been fit to drop
But the thought of you wouldn't let me stop
Now a man should stand upon his own two feet
Because the taste of failure is a bitter sweet
Please don't desert me now
I can hear the reaper calling in the wind
Please don't desert me now
You've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless
Show me mercy when i'm helpless
Shine a light in the dark
Hold me back when i get reckless
Shine a light in the dark
Stand me up if i get legless
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
Where were you when the chips were down
I fell apart when i hit the town
Where were you when i couldn't get arrested
Where were you when the lights went out
I blew a fuse, did you hear me shout
Where on earth do i look for heavens sake
There's a brotherhood that i want to see
Gotta take my share of equality
There's no harmony in a one man band
Even god almighty needs a helping hand
Please don't desert me now
There's no time and i can't fight another day
Please don't desert me now
You've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless
Show me mercy when i'm helpless
Shine a light in the dark
Hold me back when i get reckless
Shine a light in the dark
Stand me up if i get legless
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
Shine a light in the dark
