[Verse 1:]
Can i be unhappy?
Look at what i see
A beast in furs and crowned in luxury
He's a wealthy man in the poorest land
A self-appointed king
And there's no complaining while he's reigning

[Pre-Chorus:]
The lambs are bare of fleece and cold
The lion has stolen that, i'm told
There must be some creature mighty as you are

[Chorus:]
The lambs go hungry (not fair)
The biggest portion is the lion's share
There must be some creature mighty as you are

[Bridge:]
Can i be unhappy?
Listen and agree
No words can shame him or tame him

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Razor claws in velvet paws
You dunce in your guarded home
'til a stronger beast will call on you and
Pounce upon your throne
Do we pay?
Dearly, for the lion takes so greedily
And he knows that what he's taken, it is ours
That's how the wealth's divided
Among the lambs and king of the beasts
It is so one-sided
Until the lamb is king of the beasts
We live so one-sided
