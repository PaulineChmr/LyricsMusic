B E F# G#m F#
No, you don't know
B E F# G#m F#
It makes no sense
B E F# G#m F#
And there goes
B E F# G#m F#
Your confidence
E
You were so understanding
F#
So sure of yourself
G#m
But when love became damaged
C#m
You ran for help
F# B E B
How can you give up on love - Oh
F# B E B
How can you give up on love so soon
F# B E B
How can you give up on love this time
E B G#m F#
You ought to know love is hard to find

Steady B E F# G#m F#
Hold your breath B E F# G#m F#
It isn't B E F# G#m F#
Over yet B E F# G#m F#
So with one small admission E
You're paying the price F#
Did you tell yourself lying was G#m
Good advice C#m

How can you give up on love F# B E B
How can you give up on love so soon F# B E B
How can you give up on love this time F# B E B
You ought to know love is hard to find E B G#m F#

It's not easy to tell where E
Security lies F#
Is it stupid to trust in G#m
The look in her eyes C#m

How can you give up on love F# B E B
How can you give up on love so soon F# B E B
How can you give up on love this time F# B E B
You ought to know love is hard to find E B G#m F#
