[ music: John Lombardo/lyric: Natalie Merchant ]

Imitate that soured old song

There is no individuality
Only guises
Shades of
Nonconformity
There is no individuality
Selling vantage points
Low rate
There is no individuality
Questions ancient
No words claimed
Perform motions borrowed
Thoughts following
Ima tima ima tima intima
Dation
Respected
Head-he-go-round-men
Gesture display
Customer
Limits appeal
Media dictates the latest
Role
Totalitarian
Motions borrowed
Selling vantage points
Low rate
For you
Media begged
Suffered
Numbers
Pain
