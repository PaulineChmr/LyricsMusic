When I get back from hell again
I'm gonna be so elegant
The relevance of my benevolence is evident

[Verse 1]
I'm sentimental
Oh no I mean I'm said to be mental
When I don't get what I want
I find it's hard just to be gentle
Gentle? The rental of some self control
When you lose your mind
Is when you start to find your soul unfold
This morning when I woke up
All the thoughts that I had just broke up
Broken fragments of my dreams left me choked up
Distant memories I'd repressed all spoke

And the things that I've learned
Haven't been erased and wasted
When you forget about the hand your dealt
All that really matters is the things you've felt
So fuck it, bring on the good and bad times
If rapping don't work I'll start a band of mimes
When you forget about the hand you're dealt
All that really matters is the things you've felt
So fuck it, bring on the good and bad times
If rapping don't work I'll start a band of mimes when
