Turning blue, cracks appear, in the flesh on you
Recollect what you've done now that you're done
Dross and blare, "it" defined your stare and all that defines you
When the lights turn bright you look at yourself and can't see a thing

Reduced, was it worth it to you?

Now you've left the vineyards of life through the veils of death
Sweet or sour, you ask yourself was it worth the taste?
As you look down, does the suit fit well, was it worth the price?
Try to hold on to your last memories as your name dissolves

Reduced, was it worth it to you?

As the smoke of the burning dead passes through your fingers
You try to grasp it, but it's gone, their gone
You're gone, it's over

Reduced
