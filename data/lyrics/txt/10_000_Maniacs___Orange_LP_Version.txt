[ music: John Lombardo/lyric: Natalie Merchant ]

Lineage closed
Dissolved
In it's birth
Tragedy
Prelude a balance
Is a synergy
Of reason
Malicious hope
As techno atrocities
Lapse their effects
Associate these ends
Their clarity
Demands your revenge
Please compensate
Not deny

Jungle revenge
Infanticide
Crosses
Very thin walls
Latent casualties
Arrive
From fatal initiation
No longer recessive
Genetic aliens abandoned
Plain deceit
In the mirage of
A just one time cause
We'd all changed
The clocks

No ladies auxiliary to kiss
Their blistered cheeks
Gone
