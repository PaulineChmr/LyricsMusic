[Verse 1]
Lately I've been wandering
Off the narrow path
You’ve given me so many things that I've never had
And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through
If you reach deep inside you’ll see my heart is true

[Chorus]
‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight
And I know I need you in my life
Yes I hate the way I feel inside
And I promise to make the sacrifice

[Verse 2]
The world I know is pulling me
More and more each day
I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray
Spiteful eyes are watching me
With everything I do
In the midst of darkness, Lord
My spirit calls for you

[Chorus]

(You know sometimes deep inside)
I FEEL LIKE THIS!

[Chorus x2]

The Way I Feel Yeah

The Way I Feel
