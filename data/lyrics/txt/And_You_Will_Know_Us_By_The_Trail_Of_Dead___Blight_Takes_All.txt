[Verse 1]
Just another Poland pose
With this new haircut
What am I to do?
Just another ringing alarm
In this empty room
I know what I can do

[Chorus]
As spring hits my eyes
I revel in the mist
Something lustful bores a hole
Formed from doubt and worthless plans
Oh, this blight takes all

[Bridge]
What else I can I do?
When I let it go [?]

[Verse 2]
Just another death rattle dance
Are we homeward bound?
I know what can be blessed
When I heard that lost song
In this empty room
I know we'll be missed

[Chorus]
As spring hits my eyes
I revel in the mist
Something lustful bores a hole
Formed from doubt and worthless plans
Oh, this blight takes all

[Outro]
What else can I do?
When I wake up
What else can I do?
When I let it go [?]
What else can I do?
When I wake up
What else can I do?
When I let it go [?]
What else can I do?
When I let it go [?]
