Triumph of insanity
For the angels high above
Fallin' to reality, read the message in their heads

Life on earth, it will never mean
To give power to the lords
Find yourself in bad company
There might be nothing to adore...

Break the rules for the angel's cry
Read the message called Dance Or Die
