So what if it's breaking my heart at the root
Something that could happen to anyone, i suppose
Never any comfort to get from the truth
From knowing the part of this person that no one knows
So we just cry
With hopelessness
We're making such a mess

It's long gone, buddy, now - run and go after it

It's not that I’m frightened of being alone
It's just that I know what a burden this grief can be
Everything happens for something, I know
Can't understand for the moment what this could mean

That love is gone
That love is blind
That love is so unkind

It's long gone, buddy, now - run and go after it

Nobody wants to be happier more than me
Nobody wants to be happier more than I do
But happiness
I must confess
I don't have

(Can't you see what you've done, it's long gone)
It's long gone, buddy, now - run and go after it
