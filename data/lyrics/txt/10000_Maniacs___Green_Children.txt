[Verse 1]
An August day in the hills of Spain
A pair of children emerged from a cave
The strangest sight, there alone they stood
With skin of green and words no one had heard

[Verse 2]
The girl was stronger, the boy was weak
With her new mother she learned to speak
And wove a tale of a dying sun
They left the darkness
Dark world come undone

[Bridge]
They traveled so far, so far
Believing they came from a star
(humming)
(vocalizing)

[Chorus]
She fell through life
Through time
Through parallel lives

[Verse 3]
The men of science, the men of fame
The men of letters tried to explain
Was it parallel worlds or a twist of time
To make her think she'd fallen, fallen from the sky?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
A whirlwind spun them all alone
Took them from their twilight home
Believing they came from a star
(vocalizing)
