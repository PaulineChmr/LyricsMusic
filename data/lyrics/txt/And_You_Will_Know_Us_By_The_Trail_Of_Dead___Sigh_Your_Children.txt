Sigh your children, who have we?
All our lives and countless years

When the world, a glass heart aches
Wraps us up, unheard, unscathed

We, your children pine away
Your good news our destiny?
All gone

Is it something wrong
Is this what I want?
Time to fuck shit up
When all your gods turn to stone
Throw them all out the door
Out the door, out the door
Out the door, out the door
Out the door, out the door
Out the door, out the door
Out the door, out the door
Out the door, out the door
Out the door, out the door
Out the door, out the door
Out the door
