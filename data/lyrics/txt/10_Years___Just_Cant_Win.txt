You and I share the same reflection
Why dont you see that we cannot survive in this condition
If you're cut, I'll bleed
So go on carve into your own heart, I could use a new scar or a brand new start
Slowly severing the only memories that bind us as one

I just dont know
How to win with you
And I can't let go, part of me is you

We have lost all communication when words fall on deaf ears
I'm starting to feel a transformation
How did I get here?
I dont recognize my own reflection its a ghost of what once was
Gone from relative to stranger, separating body from mind

I just dont know
How to win with you
And I can't let go, part of me is you

You stay the same
Allowing me to change

I just dont know
How to win with you
I can't let go, part of me is you

I just dont know, just dont know
I can't let go, can't let go
