[Verse 1]
Look at his hand move
Check out the shape of his hips as he goes
Well he's totally natural
Well actually he's a white ghost
Performing in a video
He's totally natural

[Refrain]
He's only an actor

[Verse 2]
He's so beautiful to see
But something's lost underneath
Enter the wounded animal
Refuse the medals they bestow
Shake a hand, take a bow
It's so au natural

[Refrain]
You're only an actor
He's on the screen
He's only an actor

[Crescendo]
The chains lie broken one by one
Of the molten sod illusion
Of a broken home
Of a street fight
It's a Friday night alone
It's a bottle that's warming on the shelf
It's feeling just inches away from death
It's a street, it's an icicle
It's a panic attack, it's only an act, yeah

[Crescendo]
The chains lie broken one by one
Of the molten sod illusion
Of a broken home
It's a street fight
It's a Friday night alone
It's a bottle warming on the shelf
It's feeling just inches away from death
It's a street, it's an icicle
It's a panic attack, it's only an act, yeah

[Outro]
It's only an act, yeah
It's only an act, yeah
It's only an act, yeah
It's only an act, yeah
It's only an act, yeah
