I don't know why it's the way of the world (I don't know why it's the way of the world)
But meanwhile, meanwhile, meanwhile, meanwhile...

You've seen her sway when she walks down the street
Look at her eyes, see the glow in her cheeks
It ain't no secret, she can't hide it away
There's someone special, she's the dish of the day
She's a woman in love
She's a woman in her prime (She's a woman in love)
Look at her face it's a picture
She's a woman in love
She's a woman

This chemistry, you'll never find in a book
No ectochrome's gonna capture this look
These mixed emo's make your senses to real
You've got to be there to feel what she feels
She's a woman in love
She's a woman in her prime (She's a woman in love)
Look at her face it's a picture
She's a woman in love
She's a woman

Why should a woman in all innocence be the one to inspire looks that kill?
I don't know
I don't know why it's the way of the world
Some will win, some will lose but she can't tell

This kind of beauty comes from within
Shouldn't be allowed, yeah it's really a sin
You'd sell your soul for a night in her bed
You're far too late boy, I've already said
She's a woman in love
She's a woman in her prime (She's a woman in love)
Look at her face it's a picture
She's a woman in love
She's a woman
She's a woman in love
Look at her face it's a picture
She's a woman in love
She's a woman
She's a woman in love
Look at her face it's a picture
She's a woman in love
This one is mine
