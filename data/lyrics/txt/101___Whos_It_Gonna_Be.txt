Oh, ooh-ooh, ah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ah, ooh-ooh

I was number one for a while
Then you left me for her and it broke my heart
Now you say, you think you want me back but you don't know
You'll never change your ways

Oh oh, who's it gonna be?
Oh oh, who's it gonna be?
Oh oh, is it gonna be me?

When you called me up last night and made me smile
It was the first time in months that I heard from you
Tell me what you want from me now
Is it my turn in line or just a passing thought

Oh oh, who's it gonna be?
Oh oh, who's it gonna be?
Oh oh, is it gonna be me?

Oh oh, who's it gonna be?
Oh oh, who's it gonna be?
Oh oh, ooh oh, who's it gonna be?

This time I won't expect too much
Because I know at any time you might go back to her
While you're here with me, with all my ability I'm gonna love ya
'Cause next time it might be her

Oh oh, this time, who's it gonna be?
Oh oh, this time, who's it gonna be?
Oh oh, this time, is it gonna be me?

Oh oh, ooh ooh, who's it gonna be?
This time, is it gonna be me, who's it gonna be?
Is it gonna be me, who's it gonna be, it's gotta be
