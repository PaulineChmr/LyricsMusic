[Verse:]
Frail hinges pivot
On a cases door
Commemorative
Souvenirs from places
Containers change
With each occasion
Cellophane encased
Displaying paper
Certificate
Credit years of service
A tool of
Central enterprises
The early hope
For permanence the
Words the rings
Consistency
And social security the
Miracles high tragedy
A thought mistaken
For a memory
Clear the dust from
Smiles in boxes
Cross a patterned floor
Recall the voices
Local posts they
List your friends
In order of
Disappearance
Lawn scattered tins
Feed birds the
Portion baked for
Absent guests
Mass edition icon
God sent comfort is
Your salvation
But who grants
Absolution for sins
That never were committed
Tension
Makes a tangle
Of each thought becomes
Inconvenience
Sound never penetrate
As servile edges
Break and faint
Dress lenghts
Assassinations
Fractured family ties
Christenings
