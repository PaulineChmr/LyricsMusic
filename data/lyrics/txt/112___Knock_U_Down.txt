The way I want to knock you

Girl you got just what I need
Bring it here to me
You can stand in front of me
Or get on top of me
Cause I'm gone do to you what's never been done to you
Gonna give my all to you

[Chorus:]
It just ain't right how bad I want to knock you down
All Night riding me up & down
Feel so tight the way you squeeze it girl
Just ain't right all night so tight

Lay right there and close your eyes
Tell me what you like
Anything you want from me
Your gonna get it to night
Don't be scared to let it go
Baby let it flow
Girl I want you so bad So wet

[Chorus 2x]
Baby I promise
When our bodies touch
Anywhere you want is it what you like just let me know
I'm gonna give it all to you say yes if you feeling me
Baby I promise
I want you to feel me inside of you
I would never let your body go
I'm gonna give it all to you

[Chorus:]
