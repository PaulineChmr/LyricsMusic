Tell me when will it stop
Tell me where does it end
All the things that I do
Leave me bitter again
Hold you in the darkness
Lead you like you're blind
I gave you all you wanted
Thats the bottom line
I tried to make it
I tried to fake it
Searched for the meaning
So self-defeated
Tell me when will it stop
Tell me where does it end
All the things that I do
Leave me bitter again
Sometimes I think
That my only friend
Is this feeling I feel
When I'm bitter, bitter again
I made it all so easy
To let me suffocate
But you can rape the willing
Madness I create
I tried to make it
I couldn't take it
Can't fight the feeling
And I'm still reeling
Tell me when will it stop
Tell me where does it end
All the things that I do
Leave me bitter again
Sometimes I think
That my only friend
Is this feeling I feel
When I'm bitter, bitter again
Bitter again
Yeah, yeah
I tried to make it
I couldn't take it
I tried to fake it
But I'm done
When will it stop
Tell me where does it end
All the things that I do
Leave me bitter again
Sometimes I think
That my only friend
Is this feeling I feel
When I'm bitter, bitter again
Yeah, yeah
Bitter again
Yeah, yeah
Bitter again X4
