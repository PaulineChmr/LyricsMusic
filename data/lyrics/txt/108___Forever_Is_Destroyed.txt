Your days I grind down to dust
Your memories I bleed into the sand that buries us
Your existence just a vapor in my void
Your every hope, by me forever is destroyed

Destroyed

Your every joy I do encase
With fences barbed up tears, I mangle, deface
All you embrace, I shall erase and leave your broken heart with nothing in its place

Forever is destroyed
