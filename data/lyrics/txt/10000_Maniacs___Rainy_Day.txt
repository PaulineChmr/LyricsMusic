[Verse 1]
On bended knee
I've looked through every window then
Touched the bottom
The night, a sleepless day instead

A day when love came
Came easy like what's lost now found
Beneath a blinding
A blinding light that would surround

[Chorus]
We were, we were, we were, we were without
In doubt
We were, we were, we were, we were about
Saving for a rainy day

[Verse 2]
I crashed through mirrors
I crashed through floors of laughter then
In a blind scene
No ties would moor us to this room

A day when love came
Came easy like what's lost now found
And you would save me
And I held you like you were my child

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, if I were you, defiant you
Alone upon a troubled way
Oh, and I would send my heart to you
To save it for a rainy day

[Chorus]
[Outro]
