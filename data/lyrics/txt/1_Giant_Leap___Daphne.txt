Music is to me proof of the existence of god
It is so extraordinarily full of magic
And, and in tough times of my life
I can listen to music and it makes such a difference

Come play a while
Come dance and sing
Come fall and raise
Become kings and queens
For all we are is beautiful
You and me are the only ones

Come play a while
Come dance and sing
Come fall and raise
Become kings and queens
For all we are is beautiful
You and me are the only ones
