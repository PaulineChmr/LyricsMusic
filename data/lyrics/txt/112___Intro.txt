Like something's coming

Got that real intro type vibe to it

Yeah enough of the smooth shit

It's bad boy baby

Like the third time we've been here

Like part III motherfuckers

[112]

Just a little 112 is all you need

Just a little 112 is all you need

Just a little 112 is all you need, oh yeah

Just a little 112 is all you need

[Puff Daddy]

Let's do it
