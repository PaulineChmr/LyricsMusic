Notes: OK - instead of trying to worry about the differences between
G--Gsus, G--C/G, and G--Am7/G I'm just calling it Glick
The notes in the lick are (in order) G D G B C-C C B with
The fifth and sixth tied. The second chord "fits" with any
Of the three except that there isn't an "A" in it per se
But there does seem to be an "E". On the other hand it does
Have the same "tone" as a C/G would have. So I'm punting! :-)

*** Intro:
Glick x4

*** Verse 1:
Glick Glick Glick Glick
I used to watch her sleep an angel on vacation
Glick Glick Glick Glick
I fell in love so deep far too far to mention
Am C2
She looked just like a thousand stars
Glick Glick
When they came out at night
Am C2
But when I looked inside her heart
Glick G(1/2 lick)
I found it locked up tight

*** Chorus:
G Am7/G C2
Oh angels never help you
G Am7/G C2 G Glick x4
Cause angels always fall

*** Verse 2:
She smoked a cigarette Glick Glick
It only blurred my vision Glick Glick
I couldn't help but stay Glick Glick
With my first impression Glick Glick
I'm wondering with every breath Am C2
What caused my fall from grace Glick Glick
I guess I beat myself to death Am C2
Against her lovely face Glick Glick(1/2)

*** Chorus:
Oh angels never help you G Am7/G C2
Cause angels always fall G Am7/G C2 G (Am7)

*** Chorus:
And angels (it's simply that I never knew her) G Am7/G C2

Never call (is gone) G (Am7)
