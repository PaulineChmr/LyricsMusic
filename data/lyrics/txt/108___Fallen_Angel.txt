Fallen angel life clipped your wings
So much for those songs you sing
So much made of your never ending plight
And all the people that never did you right

Fallen angel life clipped your wings
So much for those tangled webs you weave
I won't let you roam in my head because I'm no longer in your debt

I am no longer in your debt
Fallen Angel
