[Verse 1: Hoppus & Carol]
The last time I saw you, you turned away
I couldn't see you with the sun shining in my eyes
I said "hello," but you kept on walking
I'm going deaf from the sound of the freeway
The last time I saw you, you turned away
I couldn't hear with your voice ringing in my ears
Do you remember where we used to sleep at night?
I couldn't feel you, you're always so far away

[Verse 2: Hoppus & Carol]
The first time I saw you, you turned away
I couldn't see you with the smoke getting in my eyes
I said "hello," but you kept on walking
I'm going deaf from the sound of the DJ
The first time I saw you, you turned away
I couldn't hear with the noise ringing in my ears
Do you remember where we used to sleep at night?
I couldn't feel you, you're always so far away

[Chorus: Hoppus & Carol]
I don't, don't wanna take you home
Please don't, don't make me sleep alone
If I could, I'd only want to make you smile
If you were to stay with me a while

[Verse 3: Hoppus & Carol]
The next time I see you, you'll turn away
I'll say "hello," but you'll keep on walking
The next time you see me, I'll turn away
Do you remember where we used to sleep at night?
I couldn't feel you, you're always so far away

[Chorus: Hoppus & Carol]
I don't, don't wanna take you home
Please don't, don't make me sleep alone
If I could, I'd only want to make you smile
If you were to stay with me a while

I don't, don't wanna take you home
Please don't, don't make me sleep alone
If I could, I'd only want to make you smile
If you were to stay with me a while
