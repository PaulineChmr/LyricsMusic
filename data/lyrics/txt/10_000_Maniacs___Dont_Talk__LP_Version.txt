[Verse 1:]
Don't talk, i will listen
Don't talk, you keep your distance
I'd rather hear some truth tonight
Than entertain your lies
Take you poison silently
Let me be, let me close my eyes
Don't talk, i'll believe it
Don't talk, listen to me instead
I know that if you think of it
Both long enough and hard
It's the drink you drown your troubles
In is the trouble you're in now

[Chorus:]
Talk, talk, talk about it
You talk as if you care
But when your talk is over
Tilt that bottle in the air
Tossing back more than your share

[Verse 2:]
Don't talk, i can guess it
Don't talk, well now you're restless and
You need somewhere to put the blame
For how you feel inside
You'll look for a close and easy mark and
You'll see me as fair game

[Chorus:]
Talk, talk, talk about it
Talk as if you care
But when your talk is over
Tilt that bottle in the air
Tossing back more than your share
You talk talk talk about it
You talk as if you care
I'm marking every word and
I can tell this time for sure
Your talk is the finest i have heard

[Bridge:]
Don't talk, let me go on dreaming
How your eyes they glow so fiercely
I can tell you're inspired
By the name you just chose for me
Now what was it? O, never mind

[Outro:]
We will talk, talk, talk about this
When your head is clear
I'll discuss this in the morning
But until then
You may talk but i won't hear
