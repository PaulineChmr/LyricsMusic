[Chorus]
(Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-love among the ruins)
The sky was falling
(Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-love among the ruins)
Heaven was calling
(Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-love among the ruins)
When danger crashes
(Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-love among the ruins)
Rose from the ashes

[Verse 1]
Like two statues hidden inside ancient rock
We were praying for the secrets to unlock
And when the sun had turned its back on us
Oh, in the dark our love kept track of us
Oh, pushed together by the lack of love
Oh-oh, love among the ruins

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
We held each other tightly through our hell of dreams
I still hear the never-ending echo of those screams
But it's a life not made for reliving
It's a life that makes your soul forgiving
We sealed our bond from the beginning
Oh-oh, love among the ruins

[Verse 3]
Aching affection
Vulnerable protection
Falling
Captured
Crawling
Rapture

[Chorus]
