( Dennis Drew/Natalie Merchant )

Don't talk, I will listen
Don't talk, you keep your distance
For I'd rather hear some truth tonight than entertain your lies
So take you poison silently
Let me be. Let me close my eyes

Don't talk, I'll believe it
Don't talk, listen to me instead
I know that if you think of it, both long enough and hard
The drink you drown your troubles in is the trouble you're in now

Talk talk talk about it, if you talk as if you care
But when your talk is over tilt that bottle in the air
Tossing back more than your share

Don't talk, I can guess it
Don't talk, well now your restless
And you need somewhere to put the blame for how you feel inside
You'll look for a close and easy mark and you'll see me as fair game

Talk talk talk about it, talk as if you care
But when your talk is over tilt that bottle in the air
Tossing back more than your share
You talk talk talk about it, you talk as if you care
I'm marking every word and can tell this time for sure
Your talk is the finest I have heard

So don't talk, let me go on dreaming
How your eyes they glow so fiercely I can tell your inspired
By the name you chose for me. Now what was it? O, never mind it
We will talk talk talk about this when your head is clear
I'll discuss this in the morning, but until then you may talk but I won't hear
