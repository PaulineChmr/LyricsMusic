Something was pulling me without knowing what was leading me on:
Your shining light
But you're unaware your shining light is even on
In my darkest hour the only way to bring the dawn was your shining light
And I take a chance and see it all through your eyes
Like with a little glance when you take me by surprise
By lighting up the mystery
Free me from my history and show me where to draw the line
And you don't even know that it shines
You know I will always run to your shining light
I'm not worried now about flying too close to the sun
When December skies are cold
Though it takes me by surprise
I won't abuse it so please just let it glow behind your smile
Let me feel the warmth like a little child who understands your glance
Let me use it
And I take a chance and I see it all through your eyes
