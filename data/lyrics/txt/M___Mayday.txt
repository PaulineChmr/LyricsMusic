There's another way
There must be another way
This is not a game
We will play it anyway

Stare into my screen
It gives me what I need
I'm chomping at the bit
To get my drill feed

I love your stranglehold
I need your stranglehold
Just squeeze until I go cold

Help me! Help me!
You know me better than I know myself
Mayday! Mayday!
Save me 'cause I'm a danger to myself
You know me better than I know myself

Getting nothing done
I'm getting nothing done
Failing all my friends
Now I'm failing everyone

I love your stranglehold
I need your stranglehold
Just squeeze until I go cold

Help me! Help me!
You know me better than I know myself
Mayday! Mayday!
Save me 'cause I'm a danger to myself

Help me! Help me!
You know me better than I know myself
Mayday! Mayday!
Save me 'cause I'm a danger to myself

How long
How long was I sleeping?
How long
How long was I sleeping?
How long
How long was I sleeping?
How long
How long was I sleeping?

Help me! Help me!
You know me better than I know myself
Mayday! Mayday!
Save me 'cause I'm a danger to myself

Help me! Help me!
You know me better than I know myself
Save me 'cause I'm a danger to myself

How long was I sleeping?
