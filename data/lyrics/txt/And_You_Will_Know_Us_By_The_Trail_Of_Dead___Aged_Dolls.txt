Drip, drip on to the tombs of the soulless
Drip on your aorta
Drip as fiery cinder
On to this sweltering town

No one gives a damn about your friends
This is you can count on
Drip down onto my forehead
Drip on to your aorta

So I'm sweet on you
I am transparent
So I'm sweet on you
I am a motherfucking ghost

Drip, drip on to the tombs of the soulless
Drip on your aorta
Drip as fiery cinder
On to this sweltering town

(To amuse, to seduce)
