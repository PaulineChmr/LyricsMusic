One at a time
One in the same
One is the time
That remains
Snip back the weak before they give away
I'm twisted in knots from hard work and strain

[Chorus]
I've been waiting so long for this time
I'm terrified
Blind in ways I've never realized
I don't mind

All at a time
All in the same
Califormula
I've become prey
Strolling down
In my face
These tears I'm not crying
This will not kill me

[Chorus]

To do this right
We must realize
Everyone kneads equally

[Chorus]
