[Verse 1:]
Over your shoulder
Please don't mind me
If my eyes have fallen
Onto your magazine
I've been watching and wondering
Why your face is changing
With every line you read

[Chorus:]
All those lines and circles, to me, a mystery
Eve pull down the apple and give taste to me
If she would be wonderful
But my pride is in the way
I cannot read to save my life
I'm so ashamed to say

[Verse 2:]
I live in silence
Afraid to speak
Of my life of darkness
Because i cannot read

[Chorus:]
All those lines and circles, to me, a mystery
Eve pull down the apple and give taste to me
If she could it would be wonderful
Then i wouldn't need someone else's eyes
To see what's in front of me
No one guiding me

[Verse 3:]
It makes me humble
To be so green
At what every kid can do
When he learns a to z
All those lines and circles
Just frighten me and i fear that i'll be trampled
If you don't reach for me
Before i run i'll have to take a fall
And then pick myself up, so slowly
I'll devour every one of those
Books in the tower of knowledge
