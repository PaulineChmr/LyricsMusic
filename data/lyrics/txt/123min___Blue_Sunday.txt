{Intro}

I found my own true love was
On a blue Sunday
She looked at me and told me
I was the only
One in the world
Now I have found my girl

My girl awaits for me in tender time
My girl is mine, she is the world
She is my girl

{Bridge}
La la la...

My girl awaits for me in tender time
My girl is mine, she is the world
She is my girl
