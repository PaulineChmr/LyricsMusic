There is a heart, there is a broken heart
Bleeding here and now
Memories of moments in that awful bar
You touched my face I've wasted so much time
(Stop me if it starts to hurt you, stop me if it starts to hurt)

I knew they'd find you because they get to us all
I knew they'd bind you with your back to the wall
Surrender
There is no time to lose

It's information and it's eating my eyes
It's just sensation and I'm a**uming its lies
But if it is true, then there is no time to lose

There is a mind, there is a desperate mind
Making sense of you
Staring out the dangers in those honest eyes
I need to know it all, I feel its time
(Stop me if it starts to hurt you, stop me if it starts to hurt)

Dazzled by romance and breaking news
She whispers "no chance"
Too true

It's a dilemma, there's only moments to lose
Did you remember, did you remember to choose?
Oh it's over
It was over far too soon
