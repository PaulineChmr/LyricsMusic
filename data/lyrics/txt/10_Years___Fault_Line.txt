[Verse 1]
I felt you cut free
Turning cold shoulders to me
Growing blame lines
Communicating lies
Nothing more to trust
Fallacies of love
Killing all that holds you

[Chorus]
Bring me back to this
What you said, useless
Leave me
I'll shed my skin
These scars will mend

[Verse 2]
Don't worry about me
The heart's supposed to bleed
Purity is drained
Help each other die
I see it, I see it in your eyes
Killing all that holds you

[Chorus]
Bring me back to this
What you said, useless
Leave me
I'll shed my skin
These scars will mend

[Bridge]
Eyes twitch and lies itch of nervous
Eyes twitch and lies itch of nervous ending
Innocence is ugly
In the one who is guilty

[Chorus]
Bring me back to this
What you said, useless
Leave me
I'll shed my skin
These scars will mend
