[Verse 1:]
Power, dizzy with it stumble
Detail, a chance for us to quarrel
Anger, my head is shaken violent

[Chorus 1:]
If i could calm or restrain you
For the sake of pity
Save the pistol
Save the cynic's tongue
Save the cool white stare
Treat me to an honest face sometime

[Chorus 2:]
Amaze me now!

[Verse 2:]
Trust is the greatest human error
Empty, used me as a vessel
Ruthless, you're not known for subtlety
If i could calm or restrain you
For the sake of pity
Save the pistol
Save the cynic's tongue
Save that cool white stare
And treat me to an honest face sometime

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3:]
Artful, there's quite a skill to torture
Half smile, was it all you could deliver?
Token, so hard to be pleasant

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
