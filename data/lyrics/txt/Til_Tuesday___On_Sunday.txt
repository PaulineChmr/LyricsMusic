You should take a walk

But it's talking while you're wanting to go
B F# F#m E
You're just ringing phones for fun
C#m C#m7 A
You can always make a new excuse to cry
C#m Caug E/B A#m7-5 A A2 (or C#m /C /B /A# A A2)
But you don't have to use it on yourself

So why spend your sadness now

Save it up for me on Sunday

And why is lonely all you have

When love is what you'll find on Sunday

You might guard your heart B F#
But it's awfully fun to have it broken F#m E
Or at least to leave a bruise B F# F#m E
It becomes an art B F#
Though the rules of which are rarely spoken F#m E
By the lucky ones who can choose B F# F#m E
So your pain becomes another souvenir C#m C#m7 A
And your souvenirs become your world C#m Caug E/B A#m7-5 A A2
