[Chorus 1]
Lives swallow the infatuation
Cleverly seduced
Evil's in the stink of you
Rise and fall we decompose

Rest against the sore
Push breathe and pull
Ripping out compassion
Instincts adapting
Sin sings a moan
In slides night
Unite and spread the heart apart
And smile of pain

[Chorus 2]
I can't show my true embrace
Now that you're subdued
I begin to weaken you
Rise and fall we decompose

Prey on the masses
Conscience relapses
The less we think and
More we drink our actions are casual
While sin sings a moan

[Chorus 1]

Distance is safer than trust
Honestly honesty's a fable in love
Calloused
Shedding skin I start to grin as malice
Becomes my fuel

[Chorus 2]

Shedding skin I start to grin as malice
Becomes my fuel
