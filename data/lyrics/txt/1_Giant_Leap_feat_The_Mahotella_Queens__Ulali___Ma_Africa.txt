It's my turn the short division
I'm the light that shines and guides the young
I eat before I start
But I'm not going to finish now
What's the problem?
It's in a person
It's in a person, in the world
I'm warning you, that's the truth
What's the problem?
It's in a person
It's in a person, in the world
I'm warning you, I'm warning you
It's in a person, it's in a person
I'm warning you, I'm warning you
It's the truth
Africa land for preachers gold
Land for everybody young and old
The place that holds for some bright future,
But for others the future tend to torture
Ma' Africa.
What went wrong with your brains?
You kill each other you destroy human dignity
People of Africa lets stand together
And make it the land of hope!
I want to tell everybody about myself.
