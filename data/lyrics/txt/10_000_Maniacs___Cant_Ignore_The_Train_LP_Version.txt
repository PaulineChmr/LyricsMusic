[Verse 1:]
Steep is the water tower painted
Off-blue to match the sky

[Chorus:]
Can't ignore the train

[Verse 2:]
Night walks in the valley silent
You could swear the earth just moved

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Dust to be kicked up
In the crack faced, idle, sinister town
Screen door to the rail station
Devil in her shoe
Ran along side the wasted tracks
Hem pins darted her calves

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
One spoiled girl with the tidiest apology
Some how wedged inside her throat

[Chorus]

[Verse 5:]
Patience their virtue
But i never could abide by that
Dungeon life with electric light
A clean towel and a basin
Mantle figures mind their place
Laughs where they belong
Through adventure we are not adventuresome
Some rage to share with a wardrobe mirror
In a room so beige and cold

[Chorus]

[Verse 6:]
Window days saw the children pick their
Street games on thirty afternoons
Molly the boys are
Starting in the rhyme again
Teasing more and more
The second daughter
How she fell
Young locked in some folk's prison
Made to dwell
Till they're braiding
Her grey hair

[Outro:]
Sitting in the wishing chair[x3]
