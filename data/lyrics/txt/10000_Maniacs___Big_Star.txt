I saw a big star running from me
A world from a record on my bed
Turn the tables on me
What would happen if I fell to the tune of a dreamer
To the tune of my heart?
A big start running from me
I saw a world out sunning on my head
Turn the tables on me now
I would fall from heaven and ring your bell
Baby, catch me in the middle of a lie
The boys are out tonight
Yeah the boys are out tonight
The big shots singin' from me
I saw a world out sunning on my head
Pity my heart signals:
Center of a storm inside my head
Center of my heart
Center of my out of time simple mind
From the moon out my window a wink and a blink and a nod
Had a wish on a start but now it's falling
The boys are out tonight
Big skies above me signal in my horoscope it said:
Never heed a caution
Never fought a lover
Never cross a street alone in the middle of a signal red
Middle of a drinker's heart
Middle of a big parade
A signal in my horoscope
