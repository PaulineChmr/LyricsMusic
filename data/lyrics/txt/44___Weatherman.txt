So you think you've been through it all
But I can't help but wonder now
Yesterday I found my worst regret
I'll hide it away so no one ever knows

I'm dying
I'm trying to leave

Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on
Every now and then I feel the end of us

I never meant to say I'm sorry
And I'm not sad to see you go
We're human shapes burned on concrete walls
These days the sun don't shine here anymore

I'm dying... (I find it pulling at me, a sea of troubles drowning)
I'm trying to leave (It's such a shame to feel you drifting)

Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on
Every now and then I feel the end of us
I love the way you breathe inside my head
But something's gotta change, I'm barely holding on

Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on
Every now and then I feel the end of us
I love the way you breathe inside my head
But something's gotta change, I'm barely holding on
Let me slip away, I'm barely holding on (I find it pulling at me, a sea of troubles drowning)
Every now and then I feel the end of us (It's such a shame to feel you drifting)
I love the way you breathe inside my head (I find it pulling at me, a sea of troubles drowning)
But something's gotta change, I'm barely holding on (It's such a shame to feel you drifting)

I'm barely holding on
I'm barely holding on
