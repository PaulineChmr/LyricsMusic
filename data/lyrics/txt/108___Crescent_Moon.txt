I scream to the sky, my dear crescent moon
I cry for help, she cries for hope as I fall to the ground shot full of holes
She begs for my protection
In the cool desert air

No one can keep me by her side
Oh my dear crescent moon what relief have you?
Perhaps I'm floating up to you or am I just dying?

Crescent moon I can still see you
Crescent moon I can still feel you
Even though you look so different in this light
