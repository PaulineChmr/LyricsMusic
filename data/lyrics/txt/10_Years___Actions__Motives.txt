Wait, the fact you did it
And don't admit it
Won't make you innocent
Fate finds you wicked
Turns you victim
For everything you have done
So justify the reason to kill (reason to kill)
I bet you will
Fooling no one but yourself (but yourself)
I wish you well

Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out

I just don't get it
How you managed to justify who dies
Like judge and jury
You're the very one who crucifies
Don't get your hands dirty to kill
Use someone else
Know all your lies are measured in hell
I wish you well

Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out

Can't bleed out

Actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
Hell has to notice
Your actions and motives
Bear the cross, wear the crown
It's just some evil you can't bleed out
