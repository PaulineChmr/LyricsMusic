When I'm not playing solitaire
I take a book down from the shelf
And what with programs on the air
I keep pretty much to myself
Missed the Saturday dance
Hear they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked about you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Darling I guess my mind's more at case
But nevertheless
Why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Missed the Saturday dance
Hear they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked about you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Darling I guess my mind's more at case
But nevertheless
Why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore
