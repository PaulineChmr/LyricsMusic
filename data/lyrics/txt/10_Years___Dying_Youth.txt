Deep under the surface I keep the love
Older and aware of a hidden universe
I pray to be young and pray to be inspired
Words of your tongue blister like fire

I can't let you go
Slow down don't leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me

There is a glimpse of death in your eyes
I'm not prepared to let out those cries
I plead to stay young soon will be expired
So lost in denial

I can't let you go
Slow down don't leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me

Reach in her womb shelter from strife
Bearing the gifts, burdens of life
I pray to stay young but soon will be expired
The age of innocence long sense gone

I can't let you go
Slow down don't leave
Dying days of my youth
Over take me

Fools who are looking backwards
Chose to live as statues
Frozen, fractured youthful laughter fades
