1,Dixie Chicks,There's Your Trouble,angry,"
It should've been different, but it wasn't different, was the
Same old story, ""Dear John,"" and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of true love


Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't


There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble


So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck


Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble


Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't


There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't

You take the skyway
High above the busy little one-way
In my stupid hat and gloves
At night, I lie awake wonderin' if I'll sleep
Wonderin' if we'll meet out in the street


But you take the skyway
It don't move at all like a subway
It's got bums when it's cold
Like any other place, it's warm up inside
Sittin' down and waitin' for a ride
Beneath the skyway

Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm

Golden light, oh what a fight
Another sleepless night, her dress is filigree
She tells me all her secrets then I'm back on the street

It's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night

Do you see the fire heavy lit before its time?
Know you the color of the end of the end of the end
Silence is dancing to a beating drum
Money is nothing but a loaded gun

And it's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night
In your head, in your head

It's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself

Can you tame the demon?

""Death is just a door,"" Blake said it first

We come and we go, a-weeping and a-wailing
Our heads in the hands of the nurse
Well, put your head on my shoulder, baby, tell me where it hurts
You say you lost your one and only, could it get any worse?
I say death is just a door, you'll be reunited on the other side

Addicted to a natural high
Don't know why it's appealin'
All he knows is he's got to ride


He's addicted to danger
Ruled by passion and pride
To pain and fear he's no stranger
But his lust needs to satisfied
Hooked on an eight second ride


Gettin' up down in back of the chutes
Makes that rosin burn
He's got his spurs on the heels of his boots
He's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate he settles down inside
The tension's risin'
But he can't wait until they turn that bull outside

Ruled by passion and pride
To pain and fear he's no stranger

And I won't shed no blood for you

Now's the time to face the facts
This train done slid right off the tracks
Regret is sad revenge is sweet
I'm walking on my own two feet
You could have come along but you broke my heart
Now's the time for me to start
Living my life without you
Being a rock in my shoe

Can't write the book cause this one's wrote
Time's a friend and love's a foe
The future's mine indeed it's grand
You ain't a part of my plan

In dreams of black, beyond the bounds of a withered witch's spell
Where the doors surely are locked when the sun threatens to wane
Where shamblers dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day
Liars line the roads at dawn
Watchful eyes are upon you held
Sacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell
Blood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh
Where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead
Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man
Into the tower, never go; the horrors multiply
The gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed
The rivers flow with poison
The sands swallow you whole
The ghouls that roam this darkened wood are thirsting for your throat

Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks

84,Sting,I Hung My Head,sad,"
Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head


I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head


Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head

Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead

It's called the Toxic Waltz and it's causin' devastation
You're jumpin' up and down like a psycho circus clown
Slammin' with waltzers all the way around
You get caught up in the whip, you're thrown into a flip
Then you aim for someone's head to stain the floor red
Give someone a kick to prove you're truly sick
Bounce back from some blows and blood runs out your nose

Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up! The pit is it!
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in!
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!
And this exercise helps you brutalise
With us! Exodus!

Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
Used to do the monkey, but now it's not cool
The twist and mashed potato are no exception to the rule
So don't be a dunce and dance like a runt
Just throw your elbows with good friendly, violent fun
Don't start to cry if you get a black eye
Just dive back in and give another try
But too much action may leave you in traction
So you better get insurance no matter your endurance

And thrash like an athlete!
Don't sit there on your ass
Don't look like you got too much class
You'll be harassed!

This is the key
So rage or get the third degree!

But the night can be so long when you need a friend
But maybe we could find a little piece of mind
Before the morning comes again


So pardon me, if it seems I'm holdin' on
Letting go, it just isn't easy when your sleeping all alone

And selling drugs at school

If you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss


And if you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss


Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch


Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

312,Disturbed,Indestructible,angry,"Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation: an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation, and now, my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win
I'll have you know that I've become
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war
Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
My declaration embedded deep under the skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life
You will be shown how I've become
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war
I'm indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable

It's shabby and it's torn

The shoes are scuffed and worn

And the places that she's seen
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen

Is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams

Is the hardest part when memories remain

We can share the troubles we already know

Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone

If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you

And suffer just enough to sing the blues

Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics

Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass

Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?

Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)

I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)
And now you want your money back (Your money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through


I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me

Nothing should matter

The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store
How could I let go of a miracle
Nothing could ever take its place
Thought I was looking out for myself
Now it seems the pain
Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain
Seems as though nothing will comfort me

Nothing should matter

Who's the master? Who's the disciple?
You can do what you can, but will you do it again?

Going to get war again, going to get wrong again
Gone again, with the same song again, on again
Can't be born again, who's gone again?
Who's going to gain out of this war again?
Hooligan in a tie, rule again
Soon again u will see it all begin again
Sink again, and that will make you think again

And when they call you go
When they are wrong you know
And you will fallow, and you will swallow
Again like long ago the bomb will blow
So sit back relax and enjoy the show
Cuz you are as cold as snow and I am here below
I'm going to speak out, scream out
Here we go, got the fresh flow

Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia;
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!

Christ the Savior is born!

Guys sing with us. Sing silent night, holy night

640,Marsha Ambrosius,Lose Myself,happy,"I can love you better
Lose myself in love ..

I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all i ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all i ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Try to make me feel like i was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me no!

I had to lose myself so i could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Love you better, lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is?

Couldn?t tell me i was in love when i needed it
When, all i ever wanted was love
Should a told me i was worth receiving it
But all i ever wanted was love
There?s something awkward about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see!
I had to lose myself so i could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So i could love you better
Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is?

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And i couldn?t love you perfectly with that fear in my head
So i perilously had to face the danger
So i could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul i said!
So i could make it better

I had to lose myself had to lose myself
So i could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Make it better

Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is

And so it goes that i never meant to hurt you
Couldn?t stay but i never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things i just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot of years i suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years i can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind!
I had to lose myself so i could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Love you better baby better baby
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So i could love you better baby
Had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love
Yeah, so I can love you better baby lose myself in love
Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is!

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did
Great love to absorb all the misuse i did
Hey baby it?s not an excuse i give
And i?d do it all again because for you i live

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did
Great love to absorb all the misuse i did
Hey baby it?s not an excuse i give
And i?d do it all again because for you i live

Had to lose myself so i could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love, so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So I could love you better baby baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So i could love you better baby baby baby
I can love you better baby, i could love you better , i could love you better
I can love you better I could love you better I could love you better
It sure feels right
That?s just the way it is",3091

An hour or more of teeming
Storm punching like a hurricane
That tore him out of dreaming
Air screaming through the slightest gap
Rattling between the frame and the sill
Drapes hanging from the final act
When I had you still
One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood hung of his lament
Dash him down on cold cement
One Bell Ringing
Flies buzzing round strip search light
They've got him down on his knees
He thinks of honey dripping from a spoon
Girls whispering in Portuguese
Between muzzle and the black site
Electrical contact
Deny your name and then carry the blame
Somewhat after the fact
One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood hung on that last lament
Dash him down on cold cement

718,Bobby Womack,If You Think You're Lonely Now,sad,"
I wanna dedicate this song to all the lovers tonight
And I expect that might be the whole world
Because everybody needs something or someone to love


When it's cold outside, who are you holding?
You know
If y'all don't mind, I'd like to talk about this woman of mine
She's always complaining 'bout me never being at home
But when I'm there, I'm broke
She's telling me 'bout the things that her girlfriend's got
What she ain't got
And she want me to go out and get' em for her, but
But girl, I can't be in two places at one time


If you think you're lonely now, huh
Wait until tonight, girl
I'll be long gone (If you think you're lonely now)
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right (Wait until tonight, girl)


When I ain't there to rub your back (If you think you're lonely now)
Just remember I made it a known fact (Wait until tonight, girl)
And the skeletons come out of the closet (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And chase you all around your room (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And the memories sail 'round like a ghost (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And dance around in a sad slow tune, ah

If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)
I'll be long gone (If you think you're lonely now)
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Wait, wait until tonight, girl (Wait until tonight, girl)


Girl, ain't it funny how the tables turn? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
When things aren't going your way (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
But when love walks out, and the pain walks in
And settles for a stay, ooh


Lord, help me (If you think you're lonely now)
I feel like I wanna testify (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
Girl, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely, lonely, lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, just wait until tonight, girl (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)


You see, tonight's the night when the needs come out (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
When your needs come out to breathe
And the toils and snares, and there ain't now way you can sleep, oh

If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
I feel like I wanna testify this evening (Wait until tonight, girl)
I'm lonely, 'cause I know I gotta leave you, oh, girl (If you think you're lonely now)
I just can't take no more (Wait until tonight, girl)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, girl, you just wait (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
If you think you got problems now, baby, you just wait
Wait (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
Too far gone, I'm packing up now (Wait until tonight, girl)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, babe (If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)
You say you're a little lonely (If you think you're lonely now)
But everybody needs somebody to love
(Wait until tonight, girl)


It's good that you know that you got somebody that'll stand by your side (If you think you're lonely now)
That'll build you up when you're falling down (Wait until tonight, girl)
And you had that someone, baby (If you think you're lonely now)
'Cause I've done my time
And it's your turn now (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Wait, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)

I'm tired (If you think you're lonely now)
I'm tired of the same old shuck and jive (You just wait until tonight, girl)
It's been too long
If you think we could start all over again (If you think you're lonely now)
It's been too long (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think we could start just one more time

If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big

Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'

Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It’s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted

Just tattoos of my niggas' names

A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word ""fresh"" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it

Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating,
We were the first band to vomit in the bar,
And find the distance to the stage too far,
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock,
Rock is dead they say,
Long live rock.
Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock, be it dead or alive.
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving,
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins,
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong,
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone,
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock,
Rock is dead, they say,
Long live rock.
Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock, be it dead or alive.
Landslide, rocks are falling,
Falling down 'round our very heads,
We tried but you were yawning,
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead.
The place is really jumping to the Hiwatt amps,
'Til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps,
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle,
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles,
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock,
Rock is dead, they say,
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock,
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.

While an old Love song is creeping into your head
And as your eyes just closed I could only guess
If you were dreaming of me again

Stained glass casts a flickering light
With the curtains closed I can't tell if it's night
But I know for sure that this sure feels right
With you here between my arms

On weekends selling tobacco and beer
His dreams of tomorrow surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't there
He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the 7th when Custer went down
This is the last cowboy song

Digging in the dirt
I can feel you getting closer
Steadying my hands through the blistering pain
Anxiously awaiting for the earth to reveal you
Wondering if I will ever see you again (see you again)

Wondering if I will ever see you again


I'll take your love

cause it's no longer feeling strange
to do nothing Ad nauseam nothing

Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy

But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA


Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

But sometimes it’s a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive

When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me

All I once held dear and all of my dreams

Would I love You enough to let go
Or would my love run dry
When You asked for my life

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me

If You’re all You claim to be
Then I’m not losing anything
So I will crawl upon my knees
Just to know the joy of suffering

I will love You enough to let go
Lord, I give you my life

Could not have a day that would

Just because some cannot see

that they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
all throughout the world
The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should never be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win Let it out don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

There's a demon that waits at the garden gate
If you get past him, maybe Lawrence and Phil
Will be waiting to take you to the ghost of rockschool

And the blue girl's dawn is when the sun goes down
My story tonight is from your solitude heights
I got a window on your constellation

Master I love from the ground above
As the stars below, as my memory flows
Every picture frame is beating louder than time
Every clock in the hall is bending slowly

She's in her tower and she's beautiful, sure
The quicker you learn she has no soul to discern
At least no business of yours, you bear the vacuum of scars
She was put there to tempt you like the perfume of flowers

I've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
I've seen God shining out from her reflection

'Cause if you do you can hear
There are voices still calling across the years
And they're all crying across the ocean, and they're cryin' across the land
And they will till we all come to understand
None of us are free, none of us are free
None of us are free, one of us are chained
None of us are free
And there are people still in darkness, and they just can't see the light
If you don't say it's wrong then that says it right
We got try to feel for each other, let our brother's know that we care
Got to get the message, send it out loud and clear
None of us are free, none of us are free
None of us are free, one of us are chained
None of us are free
It's a simple truth we all need, just to hear and to see
None of us are free, one of us is chained, none of us are free
Now I swear your salvation isn't too hard too find
None of us can find it on our own
We've got to join together in spirit, heart and mind
So that every soul who's suffering will know they're not alone
None of us are free, none of us are free
None of us are free, one of us are chained
None of us are free
If you just look around you, your gonna see what I say
'Cause the world is getting smaller each passing day
Now it's time to start making changes, and it's time for us all to realize
That the truth is shining bright right before our eyes
None of us are free, none of us are free
None of us are free, one of us are chained
None of us are free",1469

How can mere words my heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep so true
I've found in you
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay

I swear I feel the presence of another man

Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's all right
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know
Or somebody she just met
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

And questions to alibis

Or has her love turned into lies

The sun shining I’m prepared for the rain
You mad I’m late but be glad that I came
That ain’t blood on my shirt bitch I’m covered in stains
Like let me explain
No Batman and Robin I was really robbing
Like I ain’t have a option
Stick up kid rob the plug now I’m running plays like the auction
If I fuck around and get jammed would you write me?
Would you make sure my commissary straight that’s unlikely
I don’t even know why I bothered to ask
I might grab the K and just spaz
I really’ll give my niggas my last
If I was down bad, would you ride ‘til the wheels fell off with expired tags?
I lost my brother an it hurt
But what hurt worse
Is watching my mother shed tears ‘cause her oldest child in a hearse
But that ain’t the half shit get deeper
I hide the pain like I’m holding up strong
Really, I’m getting weaker and weaker and weaker
I had to come to my senses get my shit together
Popped a perky I feel a little better
Devil trying to take me under won’t let him

Its like I speak it fluently
Running from my past when it catch me what its gone do to me
Those cold nights in a cell
No visitation
Sunny days just precipitation
Fifteen minute phone calls wasted
In the midst of fighting all these cases
I realized who the fuck gone be out there for my babies
Nobody but me
Only the strong survive
Make your mind up decide
You fell in love like Bonnie and Clyde
I ran up a check I’m in full stride
You can be here one day and gone the next
Don’t do something that you know you gone regret
I ain’t get to tell my brother that I love him
Now I’m mad at the world, upset
I thank God that I made it
Twenty odd years rip and running these streets
Go out bad is you crazy
I feel like Tyrese Gibson I’m waste deep
Speaking on the next man situation ain’t one hunna’
The devil devoured the flower my heart crumbled
I’ma fuck around and go crazy
Why do we live?
Why do we die?
What is the purpose?
Suicidal thoughts like is this shit really worth it
What the fuck did I do to deserve this
Hold ya head high when that bullshit start to surface

The sun comes out
Last night was shaking
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong
With another sin
The night is calling
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
He's licking his lips
He's ready to win
On the hunt tonight
For love at first sting

Black magic rites on this black evil night
Begin with the slice of the blade
Metal and blood come together as one

Taste the sweet blood of one another
Sharing without any greed
Bang your head, as if up from the dead
Intense metal is all that you need

Crowd begins to bang
And there's blood upon the stage
Bang your head against the stage
And metal takes its price

Metal takes hold, death starts to unfold
It's loud like the world's at an end
You're in a blood fury, the metal won't stop
Onlookers, they bang at command
Cutting your palm and drinking your blood
The power that few others dare
You feel the need to go out and kill
The same need that your blood brother shares

Look at your women crying

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said ""Peace could last forever""
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land

I don't need your civil war

Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on and the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars
We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

It feeds the rich while it buries the poor

A calm serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide
Gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun
Surrounded by everything I want
But nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdity
Losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need
To find that road
Right around that curve a lesson learned
Now that I have the eyes to see
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again
With poison toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treause is
'Cause they only blocked my view
I'm spiraling down but so oblivious
Got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again
Sometimes I cried, the tears wouldn't fall
And sometimes I tried to break those walls
And feel your love
But I came alive inside
When I finally found my way
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again",1367

There's a reason why I bring
You this simple offering
Pouring out my love to You
And though my heart cannot express
All this joy and gratefulness
Still I sing this song of love and thanks and praise


It's because I'm forgiven
It's because I am free
It's because You've shown my mercy
And You believed in me
It's because You are my Savior
It's because You are my friend
And Your love it lifts me higher
Than I've ever been


Oh the wonder of Your ways
Oh the measure of Your grace
Greater than my heart can know
So how could I not celebrate
How could I not bless Your name
Singing out a song of love and thanks and praise

It's because I'm forgiven
It's because I am free
It's because You've shown my mercy
And You believed in me
It's because You are my Savior

We, the people speak, speak
We want to be free of this sick bureaucracy
No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life

It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak

Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak

Your lies are your destruction, your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal, you are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow, your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage, it rots and it reeks
Of death in the wind, the foul stench of men
Basking in their cruelty, rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride, you risk all of humanity

You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know, people they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace

But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach
Deep, deep down in our beings
Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things

As our grandmothers say
Will soon be no more, will soon be no more
Because nobody, no one ever wins a war",3386

And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats itself
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me

A dark cloud covered my heart
Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

No matter how strong a man is
Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart
A lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Because I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again",1092

The reason for this wrath bestowed by flame beyond the sea
Tonight I've heard the cry and swear by all I've seen
That vengeance will one day be mine satisfaction will I breathe

I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride

1379,The Roots,The Fire,angry,"Intro: John Legend]
Ohhhh
The fire, the fire
Ohhhh
The fire, the fire


There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn


Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul start to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes
And in tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize
I realized I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn


One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake

Ohhhh
The fire, the fire
Ohhhh
The fire, the fire


There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?""
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door


Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead


Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be so, o, o, o""
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead (Do-do-do-do-do)


P. C. 31 said, ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind


Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer

They took me lightly like a quiet boosting of a piece of candy
From your favorite neighborhood corner store
Surely shoulda saw the weight
A heavy burden to carry the bare soiled slate
They don't wanna have a thing to do with
Can't blame them take a look
Can't name 'em cause they shook
Took over some wit-protect
Stay with your kin boy
Fuck around with B'more
Make you look like you're white in a Harlem shaking contest
I harness the fondest crooks of phonics
Fuck grammar, ill-mannered
Don't start with Spank

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Awww ease up motherfucker, take a breath
You look beat, I'm more you're more the less
Oh ease up motherfucker, take a breath
You look beat now, now I suggest you take a rest

Can't say what I will or won't do
Stretch the height
You might want to stay on your toes to
Secure a full view
For skewed vision conditions lead you to assume
And while you assume
I'm feeling uneasy
My patterns are broken
Shared my thoughts but my guts don't even believe me
Sleep don't relieve me, it's like doom conceived me
Got a whole lot of something, yet I constantly feel
Like nothing much, just your average such and such
So much acclaimed moving
But nigga I'm really touched

What was I drinking?
(falling under would've boxed that nigga
If you didn't pull me back, spitting on his new shoes)

What was he thinking?
(man I wonder, do I smile too much?
Yes, you too can get fucked up)

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it...

I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it and in the end
All these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me what it...

I'm sick with it, I stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is

(sit the fuck…there ain't no dancing, no dancing)


My tongue is the drum
My mind’s the machine
Non dreamer's far fantastic extremes
Fall victim to this think tank-M16
Sound, sharp, fixed, fit, creased, greased, and clean

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it...

There's so much competition but the best don't always win
